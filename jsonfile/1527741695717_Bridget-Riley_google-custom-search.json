        "text": "To walk into Bridget Riley’s exhibition of new works – everything here, with a couple of exceptions, has been created in the last four years – is to see a mighty brain fizzing away with ideas that blow away all the sentimental cobwebs from art. Riley is a philosopher who is interested in perception – and nothing else. For her, a work of art is not a picture nor a political comment nor a splurge of self-expression. It is a way to explore seeing. If it does not leave you with your sense of the visible world shaken and reborn, what’s the point of it?In the early 1960s, she took on the epic sweep of American art and gave it a sharp scientific twist. Jackson Pollock’s paintings absorb the beholder in poetic tangles and forests of colour. Riley liked the scope and sweep, yet she put it all in a more solid psychological basis. The curves and eddies, twists and vortices of her early black and white paintings such as Hesitate (1964) are mathematically calculated. Their discombobulating effects are precisely planned. They turn perception inside out as you find spaces move and melt, shapes materialise in front of the canvas, reality itself burst open to reveal new dimensions. In the decade of psychedelia, Riley invented a legal hallucinogenic. Her new exhibition harnesses that drug again. I confess that I was expecting to respect this exhibition rather than enjoy it. Riley has continued to explore abstract art all her life, in inventive and thoughtful ways, but often with quieter, calmer results than her early, revolutionary art. What a thrill that in her new show she unleashes once again the monochrome psychedelic energy of her youth. A gigantic wall painting interlaces black and white curves and triangles with what seems at first like a calm geometrical elegance. Shapes tessellate like the patterns of medieval Islamic tiles in the Alhambra. But then, as your eyes adjust ... they can’t quite adjust. There is somehow too much to take in. The rhythm this jazzy mural creates is so complex and strange it befuddles your brain. Perhaps the framed paintings would be easier on the eye. But no. Looking at Cascando and Rustle 6 – both painted in 2015 – I find myself seeing depths where there are no depths, a sublime architecture of black boxes appearing and vanishing. It is dizzying and disorientating. You could set these paintings beside a cubist masterpiece from 1910 The rest of the exhibition is more like what I expected of later Riley - but scintillating all the same. In a sequence of paintings called Measure for Measure, she plays with patterns of circles in just three colours – purple, orange and green. All three colours are warm, slightly muted, richly suggestive. I was so struck that I asked for an exact definition of them. The answer that came back from Riley’s studio: “They are purple, orange and green.” The way these dots interact is a 21st-century echo of the pointillist paintings of Georges Seurat, whose art Riley studied and copied when she was developing her concept of perceptual art. On the other hand, perhaps she did the Measure for Measure series to show Damien Hirst who’s boss. We don’t have many artists in British history who rethink the very nature of perception as it was rethought by Cézanne, Picasso or Seurat. You could set the paintings in this exhibition beside a cubist masterpiece from 1910, a Cézanne view of Mont Sainte-Victoire or Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and the dialogue would be fascinating. Or if that sounds too hifalutin, let’s just say Riley’s recent work blew my mind. Bridget Riley, Recent Paintings 2014 – 2017 is at David Zwirner Gallery, London, from 19 January until 10 March.

That was because this short-lived experimental artist (born in 1859, died in 1891) analysed the visual world like a chemist. Seurat’s pointillist fields of coloured dots break up visual experience into its myriad constituent parts and reveal the complex nature of perception. Yet his art is not cold or clinical. On the contrary, Seurat’s carefully planned compositions are full of emotional power. This study for his great 1884 painting Bathers at Asnières – which the National Gallery owns – is poignant and disconcerting. A heap of clothes abandoned on the shore could belong to a swimmer or a suicide. The shimmering river isn’t saying.

That was because this short-lived experimental artist (born in 1859, died in 1891) analysed the visual world like a chemist. Seurat’s pointillist fields of coloured dots break up visual experience into its myriad constituent parts and reveal the complex nature of perception. Yet his art is not cold or clinical. On the contrary, Seurat’s carefully planned compositions are full of emotional power. This study for his great 1884 painting Bathers at Asnières – which the National Gallery owns – is poignant and disconcerting. A heap of clothes abandoned on the shore could belong to a swimmer or a suicide. The shimmering river isn’t saying. Over this ambiguous pastoral moment, the tall thin chimneys of factories pump their grey smoke into the pale air.

        "text": "Is there any season more synonomous with good food shared with the best of friends and most beloved of family? Tis truly the season for all who love to cook (and eat). Here’s a selection of our favorite beautifully designed tools, accessories, and ingredients to serve those who aspire to drink, eat, and be merry throughout the year.HAY FIELD Chopping Board \\\\\\ $58.50 Designer Shane Schneck’s three beech cutting board designs are like a Bridget Riley painting captured in wood, the Op-Art grooves ideal for capturing errant bread crumbs or the juice from a steak with indelible style. Groove is in the heart, or something like that.Tom Dixon Brew V60 Giftset \\\\\\ $120 Making a cup of pour-over coffee has never been quite as sexy as imagined by Tom Dixon. The mirror black, all-metal espresso sized cups and dripper cone imply drinking something dark, rich, and unadulterated.Gaea Black and White Gift Set \\\\\\ $30 Olive oil and balsamic vinegar presented in a stark monochromatic set. Give it to the aesthete gourmand who openly admits, “I bought it because I liked the packaging!”Miele CM6150 Coffee Maker \\\\\\ $1499 I love, love, love my Miele vacuum cleaner. But I also aspire to one day own one of their one-touch automatic coffee machines after trying a cup (or two) expertly produced at their showroom. Precise German engineering, austere-minimalist design, and a compact footprint = want.Click & Grow Indoor Smart Fresh Herb Garden Kit \\\\\\ $60 The days are getting shorter, the light noticeably dimmer – a bane for gardeners who grow their own sprigs of herbs for cooking outside. A growing device like the Click & Grow – a system inspired by NASA – brings the gardens indoors, and also takes responsibility for watering and producing enough light for seeds to sprout into your future meal.Nambu Tekki Cast Iron Skillet \\\\\\ $180 Nobuho Miya’s lineage related to nambu testu ironware (traditional Japanese cast iron) spans back to the Meiji era, but his style is distinctly contemporary. At less than half the weight of a typical cast iron skillet, the Nambu Tekki Cast Iron skillet is truly manageable with one hand, unlike its heavy metal counterparts.Uuni 3 Wood Fired Oven \\\\\\ $299 Producing temperatures well past 900 degrees – twice as hot as the typical kitchen oven – the Uuni 3 is probably as close as one can get to having a pizza oven without building something hulking and hot. Besides the fast cooking times, what a wood-fired oven offers is that delicious char along the edges of pizza, fish, meats, vegetables, and bread. Whoever you give this to owes you a lifetime of pizzas.Atlas Coffee Club + Yield Glass Pour Over \\\\\\ starting at $60 \\\\\\ $32 What coffee loving addict wouldn’t want a 3, 6, or 12 month subscription of coffee customized to their preference in region, roast, and amount?

        "text": "For this week’s Friday Five, we check in with the London-born Brandon Haw who is the President and CEO of his eponymous, New York-based architecture and design studio. Growing up in the 60s with artist parents, Haw gravitated to the minimalist and conceptual art world that the period was known for. After attending London’s Bartlett School of Architecture and Planning, he crossed the pond and earned his Master’s Degree in Architecture from Princeton University. After school and until 1987, Haw worked on commercial high rise projects at the New York offices of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill before returning back to London. Over the next 26 years, he rose to Director and Senior partner in the office of Lord Norman Foster, where he oversaw a variety of projects including the Hearst Tower in NYC, the Faena House residential project in Miami, the HSBC World Headquarters in London, and the Commerzbank Headquarters in Frankfurt. 2010 saw a move back to the USA to head up the offices of Foster and Partners before setting up his own practice in 2014 in the famed Mies Van der Rohe Seagram Building. Here, Brandon Haw gives us a look at five things that keep him happy and inspired.Courtesy of Artsy1. Bridget Riley’s, 19 Greys Having been born into a family of artists, an appreciation of the visual and performing arts is part of my DNA. I am particularly fond of Bridget Riley’s seminal 19 Greys (1968), a series of four color studies, which I am fortunate enough to wake up to every morning. Their control and complexity not only captures the essence of her work from the beginning of her prolific career, but they also remind me, as my minimalist father taught me, that a good base structure always underlies — creativity.Courtesy of Brandon Haw Architecture2. Le Presbytere, Pays Basque Le Presbytere is our home in the Pays Basque. Located 40 minutes from the Atlantic Ocean and 40 minutes from the peaks of the French Pyrenees, this is my spiritual retreat. Great food and wine, and a place to recharge and ground oneself in the simplicity of this rural community. I am always particularly aware of the weather and seasonal cycles here. From hikes along the peaks with far reaching views across the mountains to windswept walks along the expansive sand dunes, this place – brings me to a point of quiet reflection and connection to the earth and sky.3. Books I love books, all kinds. Books on art, on design, on nature, on politics, on philosophy, on economics, you name it. One of my most loved possessions is the large format GOAT (Greatest of All Time) boxed volume on the life of Muhammad Ali by Taschen. Not only was he one of recent history’s most remarkable human beings, but the book reminds me of my own grandfather’s humble and tough beginnings. When he taught me to box it was more about self-respect and discipline, than the desire to physically hurt someone.Gregorio Uribe Big Band \\\\\\ Photo by Fernando Lodeiro4. Latin Music The ability for music and dance to bring people together from all walks of life never ceases to impress me. My travels throughout South America opened my inner rhythms to the joys of Salsa, Cumbia and Palenque music: popular music of the indigenous regions of Colombia with roots in African tribal music fused with indomitable Latin percussion and accompanied by words and stories to make ones heart cry with joy and sadness!Courtesy of Brandon Haw Architecture5. Horseback Riding There is something entirely visceral and exhilarating about horseback riding. I am always in awe at the ease by which the “vaqueros” treat the horses, just as if they were an extension of their own being, such is the everyday unthinking relation between the two. Riding amongst the steep hills and valleys of the Colombian landscape takes me to a different time and place, far away from my other great love New York City.For this week’s Friday Five, we check in with the London-born Brandon Haw who is the President and CEO of his eponymous, New York-based architecture and design studio.

Over the next 26 years, he rose to Director and Senior partner in the office of Lord Norman Foster, where he oversaw a variety of projects including the Hearst Tower in NYC, the Faena House residential project in Miami, the HSBC World Headquarters in London, and the Commerzbank Headquarters in Frankfurt. 2010 saw a move back to the USA to head up the offices of Foster and Partners before setting up his own practice in 2014 in the famed Mies Van der Rohe Seagram Building. Here, Brandon Haw gives us a look at five things that keep him happy and inspired.For this week’s Friday Five, we check in with the London-born Brandon Haw who is the President and CEO of his eponymous, New York-based architecture and design studio. Growing up in the 60s with artist parents, Haw gravitated to the minimalist and conceptual art world that the period was known for.

Bridget Riley’s, 19 Greys Having been born into a family of artists, an appreciation of the visual and performing arts is part of my DNA. I am particularly fond of Bridget Riley’s seminal 19 Greys (1968), a series of four color studies, which I am fortunate enough to wake up to every morning. Their control and complexity not only captures the essence of her work from the beginning of her prolific career, but they also remind me, as my minimalist father taught me, that a good base structure always underlies — creativity.Bridget Riley’s, 19 GreysCourtesy of Brandon Haw ArchitectureCourtesy of Brandon Haw Architecture2. Le Presbytere, Pays Basque Le Presbytere is our home in the Pays Basque. Located 40 minutes from the Atlantic Ocean and 40 minutes from the peaks of the French Pyrenees, this is my spiritual retreat. Great food and wine, and a place to recharge and ground oneself in the simplicity of this rural community. I am always particularly aware of the weather and seasonal cycles here. From hikes along the peaks with far reaching views across the mountains to windswept walks along the expansive sand dunes, this place – brings me to a point of quiet reflection and connection to the earth and sky.3. Books I love books, all kinds. Books on art, on design, on nature, on politics, on philosophy, on economics, you name it. One of my most loved possessions is the large format GOAT (Greatest of All Time) boxed volume on the life of Muhammad Ali by Taschen. Not only was he one of recent history’s most remarkable human beings, but the book reminds me of my own grandfather’s humble and tough beginnings. When he taught me to box it was more about self-respect and discipline, than the desire to physically hurt someone.GOAT (Greatest of All Time)Gregorio Uribe Big Band \\\\\\ Photo by Fernando LodeiroGregorio Uribe Big Band \\\\\\ Photo by Fernando Lodeiro4. Latin Music The ability for music and dance to bring people together from all walks of life never ceases to impress me. My travels throughout South America opened my inner rhythms to the joys of Salsa, Cumbia and Palenque music: popular music of the indigenous regions of Colombia with roots in African tribal music fused with indomitable Latin percussion and accompanied by words and stories to make ones heart cry with joy and sadness!Courtesy of Brandon Haw ArchitectureCourtesy of Brandon Haw Architecture5. Horseback Riding There is something entirely visceral and exhilarating about horseback riding. I am always in awe at the ease by which the “vaqueros” treat the horses, just as if they were an extension of their own being, such is the everyday unthinking relation between the two. Riding amongst the steep hills and valleys of the Colombian landscape takes me to a different time and place, far away from my other great love New York City."

        "text": "Looking from Bridget Riley’s mind-boggling 1960s paintings to Georges Seurat’s calm river scene in The Bridge at Courbevoie, painted in 1886-7, is not only thought-provoking but puts your eyes to the test. After looking at her pounding psychedelic art, I could barely see the Seurat. I had to let my eyes readjust before I could properly make out its misfits and fishermen on the banks of the Seine, let alone appreciate the play of tiny dots that creates its pointillist shimmer.Riley is the most revolutionary British painter of modern times. Her paintings don’t merely hang on the wall: they warp and pulsate, sucking your imagination into unreal worlds of impossible depth and hallucinatory colour. What was she on when she came up with her dangerous vision? Late Morning I, 1967. Photograph: Karsten Schubert/The Courtauld gallery It turns out she was simply looking at a painting by Seurat, the postimpressionist who created a new way of seeing the world as a field of coloured dots. The Courtauld Gallery owns The Bridge at Courbevoie, one of Seurat’s still, silent masterpieces, and in 1959 the young Riley set out to make a copy of it. It still hangs in her studio, which shows how crucial Seurat, who died in 1891 in his early 30s, has remained to her thinking about art. Riley has also called her copy – which she has lent to this fascinating little exhibition – a “tool”, revealing what her and Seurat have in common: they both practice art as an optical science.This intense exhibition – just one room hung with stunning art – is an antidote to all the loose talk these days about contemporary art interacting with the “masters”. From shows of Rubens or Botticelli that are top-loaded with contemporary art to the Frieze Masters art fair, the art world likes to claim continuity and connection between old and new. All too often, such claims are insubstantial. But Riley really did forge her optical style by studying Seurat, so this is a genuine encounter between old and new.Then again, Riley is no ordinary artist: she is truly intelligent and free from sentimental egotism about the artist’s role. In 1959, male painters like Bacon and De Kooning were spattering oils about and airily being compared with Velázquez. Yet there was young Riley, then 28, putting herself through school, modest and free from macho vanity. Working from an image in a book, she imitated Seurat’s Bridge on a bigger scale, with more fulsome dots, as she tried to understand how his pointillist method exploits the power of complementary colours. She started painting her own pointillist landscapes. (Her picture of the sun-filled hills of Tuscany could easily pass for a postimpressionist original – it’s a good thing she never went into faking.) From there she created the abstract masterpiece Tremor, whose convulsive beauty takes apart your senses and rearranges your neurons.My mind is blown, but stimulated as well, for Riley has something else in common with Seurat and the other great artists of late 19th-century France besides an interest in the science of colour: a joy for life. We so easily mistake misery for seriousness – images of death and despair are hailed as profound. But in Seurat’s age, the sheer pleasure of the eye, the ecstasy of seeing, was radical. Colour and light were beams of hope. Riley also creates visual pleasure. Her assault on stale reality is to create a utopian explosion of joy.When your eyes finally adjust, the delirium of her work casts new light on Seurat. He suddenly looks very 1960s himself. A smokestack in the distance in The Bridge at Courbevoie turns out, on closer inspection, to be a column of sparkling jewels out of which a vapour of emerald dust floats upward.Beside the Seurat hangs Riley’s painting Vapour, whose bands of colour seem restrained until you realise they are melding in your mind to create the illusion of a lime-green mist floating in space. A few great paintings of this calibre, so intelligently compared and spaciously displayed, are worth a dozen ill-conceived blockbusters. Georges Seurat was a genius, and so is Bridget Riley. Together, they set the air alight. Bridget Riley: Learning from Seurat is at Courtauld Gallery, London, from 17 September to 17 January 2016.

        "text": "Bridget Riley has a story to tell about the 1960s. And who wouldn't want to hear that? Riley was one of the makers of the most glamorous decade of the 20th century - one of its most gifted and radical visionaries. She created revolutionary works of art almost by mistake, stepped back from the commercial world she'd blundered into, but then - far from retreating into conservatism - continued experimenting on the cutting edge not just of art but society, and has maintained an extraordinarily brilliant output of pure abstract art until today. She rarely gives interviews, but there is a tale she's burning to relate, about what she and her friends did in London in 1968. And like I say - who wouldn't want to hear that?She is making coffee in her vast studio space in east London, where a long bare rectangular canvas is expectantly propped against the longest wall. A gigantic tabletop is laid out with designs, sketches, watercolours and collage maquettes for paintings in various stages of development. Each is totally abstract - Riley has not painted anything figurative since the 1950s, when she researched the place of optical effects in art by copying the works of the 19th-century pointillist Georges Seurat. The designs she's tinkering with are all curving waves of red and green, interleaving petals of colour like the tiled patterns you might see in a medieval Islamic palace.Riley is 77, but her studio is a busy place. I arrived early; before she turned up a team of art handlers rang the doorbell and collected a pulsing new diagonal-patterned painting. She has a retrospective on at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. \"Being an artist does mean knowing something about oneself,\" she says. \"The way in which you do that is through working.\"It was her love of work that got her involved in a radical art movement in London in the year of revolution, 1968, when she led a utopian community of artists, in the unlikely setting of St Katharine's Dock. It was all because she wanted working space, as did her friend the architect and self-taught artist Peter Sedgley. They had been included, in 1965, in the same New York exhibition - The Responsive Eye, at the Museum of Modern Art - and became fast friends. \"We were very close,\" she says.Op art, the movement launched by that exhibition, willfully creates a perceptual confusion analogous with drug experiences. A photograph of The Who in 1966 shows them posing in front of the Union flag, with the drummer Keith Moon in a T-shirt emblazoned with Riley's painting Blaze, whose swirling vortex he displays like a heraldic sign of hallucinatory ferment. Riley was upset by the commercialisation of op art and in some ways has spent a lifetime living it down, stressing the roots of her painting in French post-impressionism, but Sedgley's paintings were more fizzy, vulgar and Buddhist-looking - openly psychedelic.In 1968 the two were based at Riley's house in Notting Hill, west London, when their experiments got too big for it. \"Peter wanted to build a geodesic dome in the house\" - the hi-tech utopian architecture invented by Buckminster Fuller - \"and he did.\" But it was a tight squeeze, and got them talking about the idea of finding new, much bigger types of space for artists in London.Riley had been impressed with the post-industrial loft spaces artists in Manhattan were living and working in. She decided to find an industrial space for artists in London, and to found an organisation to run it. And so, 40 years ago, SPACE was born, standing for Space Provision Artistic Cultural and Educational.As Riley tells it, she was the sensible one in their partnership. She was the star of the op movement, her paintings copied by designers, and her fame could get them a hearing from the establishment. It is easy to picture her impressing bureaucrats. She speaks precisely in a refined accent and recalls the time she \"had tea with Agnes Martin in New York\" - the picture of a polite meeting between these two great abstract artists materialises. She is highly articulate and educated, has written many essays on modern art, and does not see herself as in any way a pop figure: in 1965 she denounced the way her art was being \"vulgarised in the rag trade\". Yet every so often, Riley jumps up and all but dances around the room - she moves like a cat, and for a moment becomes the artist who posed in a black shirt and white skirt between her zebra-stripe paintings in a famous 60s photograph.\"Part of Peter's dream,\" she recalls fondly, \"was a community of artists. His idea was very much like Van Gogh's.\" In the late 1880s Vincent van Gogh tried to found a visionary community of artists in Arles. It ended in violence, madness and self-harm. In other words, SPACE was an attempt to build utopia.Sedgley wanted to squat. This was in the last days of London's dockyards. For miles along the Thames, old warehouses stood empty and rotting. The first place they looked at was the empty Marshalsea prison in Southwark: \"Peter fell in love with it and wanted to squat there. Squatting was just becoming a way of coping with London's housing crisis.\"But instead of squatting in a Dickensian ruin, they found the ivory warehouse at St Katharine's Dock, architecturally rock solid but abandoned. Its owners, the Greater London council, let them have it for \"a peppercorn rent\" provided they agreed to leave when the developers moved in. The docks \"were knee deep - well, in several inches of pigeon shit\". Volunteers slept at Riley's house while they were making the place habitable. The Boyle family, renowned conceptual artists, \"toiled away on that pigeon shit\".Sedgley wanted \"a great big open space with all the artists working in it.\" Instead, they got temporary partitions. Everyone moved in, there was a party, then they were thrown out. St Katharine's Dock became the pilot for the redevelopment of London's Docklands. In the next few years they found space after space, moving every time without fuss, resisting the urge to squat - \"An artist has to be realistic or they wouldn't be able to realise anything. Imagination has to be captured by reality.\"\"Power to the Imagination\" went one of the slogans in Paris in 1968. Imagination and reality fused in London's docklands, just as they were being synthesised across the world. Riley is rightly proud of SPACE, still going strong after 40 years. She talks eloquently about that time, the ideals she admired in Sedgley. \"He adored this, it was heaven, and he was tremendously well suited to it. I also think possibly from the [second world] war I knew about changing social conditions and one had a sense of what we now call the community.\"That social vision is fundamental to understanding Bridget Riley. Her belief that art is something interactive and living, so dramatised by what she did in 68, pervades her work. Art, she tells me, \"is a social act. My work is completed by the viewer.\" And she turns this into a joke: \"Well, if no one was there to look at it ...\" - but it's true.Her 1960s paintings like Current (1964) with its warping black and white flow that suddenly tightens into a faster, shorter frequency at the centre, create rhythms whose power is more than poetic. Your eye is taken for a ride.Her art got more expansive, in the new industrial space. \"It gave me the chance to make big paintings.\" These paintings replaced the intense hallucinatory effects of her black-and-white works with kaleidoscopic colour. And here we are today, in a converted building in Mile End, where she still comes to work from her home in west London.She likes that distance between herself and work, she says. Painters are admired for expressing inner life, for subjective vision. Riley's art declares that another beauty, another power, exists not in private selves but in the dialogue between human beings. It is quintessentially an art born in the 60s and yet it is still truthful today. The social and collective vision of 1968, which she shared and realised through SPACE, is basic to her artistic vision.When you look at her paintings, you don't ponder them, you live them.You are set free by them: in this art the revolution continues.Bridget Riley has a story to tell about the 1960s.

And like I say - who wouldn't want to hear that?Bridget RileyShe is making coffee in her vast studio space in east London, where a long bare rectangular canvas is expectantly propped against the longest wall. A gigantic tabletop is laid out with designs, sketches, watercolours and collage maquettes for paintings in various stages of development. Each is totally abstract - Riley has not painted anything figurative since the 1950s, when she researched the place of optical effects in art by copying the works of the 19th-century pointillist Georges Seurat. The designs she's tinkering with are all curving waves of red and green, interleaving petals of colour like the tiled patterns you might see in a medieval Islamic palace.Riley is 77, but her studio is a busy place. I arrived early; before she turned up a team of art handlers rang the doorbell and collected a pulsing new diagonal-patterned painting. She has a retrospective on at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. \"Being an artist does mean knowing something about oneself,\" she says. \"The way in which you do that is through working.\"It was her love of work that got her involved in a radical art movement in London in the year of revolution, 1968, when she led a utopian community of artists, in the unlikely setting of St Katharine's Dock. It was all because she wanted working space, as did her friend the architect and self-taught artist Peter Sedgley. They had been included, in 1965, in the same New York exhibition - The Responsive Eye, at the Museum of Modern Art - and became fast friends. \"We were very close,\" she says.ArtOp art, the movement launched by that exhibition, willfully creates a perceptual confusion analogous with drug experiences. A photograph of The Who in 1966 shows them posing in front of the Union flag, with the drummer Keith Moon in a T-shirt emblazoned with Riley's painting Blaze, whose swirling vortex he displays like a heraldic sign of hallucinatory ferment. Riley was upset by the commercialisation of op art and in some ways has spent a lifetime living it down, stressing the roots of her painting in French post-impressionism, but Sedgley's paintings were more fizzy, vulgar and Buddhist-looking - openly psychedelic.In 1968 the two were based at Riley's house in Notting Hill, west London, when their experiments got too big for it. \"Peter wanted to build a geodesic dome in the house\" - the hi-tech utopian architecture invented by Buckminster Fuller - \"and he did.\" But it was a tight squeeze, and got them talking about the idea of finding new, much bigger types of space for artists in London.Riley had been impressed with the post-industrial loft spaces artists in Manhattan were living and working in. She decided to find an industrial space for artists in London, and to found an organisation to run it. And so, 40 years ago, SPACE was born, standing for Space Provision Artistic Cultural and Educational.As Riley tells it, she was the sensible one in their partnership. She was the star of the op movement, her paintings copied by designers, and her fame could get them a hearing from the establishment. It is easy to picture her impressing bureaucrats. She speaks precisely in a refined accent and recalls the time she \"had tea with Agnes Martin in New York\" - the picture of a polite meeting between these two great abstract artists materialises. She is highly articulate and educated, has written many essays on modern art, and does not see herself as in any way a pop figure: in 1965 she denounced the way her art was being \"vulgarised in the rag trade\". Yet every so often, Riley jumps up and all but dances around the room - she moves like a cat, and for a moment becomes the artist who posed in a black shirt and white skirt between her zebra-stripe paintings in a famous 60s photograph.\"Part of Peter's dream,\" she recalls fondly, \"was a community of artists. His idea was very much like Van Gogh's.\" In the late 1880s Vincent van Gogh tried to found a visionary community of artists in Arles. It ended in violence, madness and self-harm. In other words, SPACE was an attempt to build utopia.Sedgley wanted to squat. This was in the last days of London's dockyards. For miles along the Thames, old warehouses stood empty and rotting. The first place they looked at was the empty Marshalsea prison in Southwark: \"Peter fell in love with it and wanted to squat there. Squatting was just becoming a way of coping with London's housing crisis.\"But instead of squatting in a Dickensian ruin, they found the ivory warehouse at St Katharine's Dock, architecturally rock solid but abandoned. Its owners, the Greater London council, let them have it for \"a peppercorn rent\" provided they agreed to leave when the developers moved in. The docks \"were knee deep - well, in several inches of pigeon shit\". Volunteers slept at Riley's house while they were making the place habitable. The Boyle family, renowned conceptual artists, \"toiled away on that pigeon shit\".Sedgley wanted \"a great big open space with all the artists working in it.\" Instead, they got temporary partitions. Everyone moved in, there was a party, then they were thrown out. St Katharine's Dock became the pilot for the redevelopment of London's Docklands. In the next few years they found space after space, moving every time without fuss, resisting the urge to squat - \"An artist has to be realistic or they wouldn't be able to realise anything. Imagination has to be captured by reality.\"\"Power to the Imagination\" went one of the slogans in Paris in 1968. Imagination and reality fused in London's docklands, just as they were being synthesised across the world. Riley is rightly proud of SPACE, still going strong after 40 years. She talks eloquently about that time, the ideals she admired in Sedgley. \"He adored this, it was heaven, and he was tremendously well suited to it. I also think possibly from the [second world] war I knew about changing social conditions and one had a sense of what we now call the community.\"That social vision is fundamental to understanding Bridget Riley. Her belief that art is something interactive and living, so dramatised by what she did in 68, pervades her work. Art, she tells me, \"is a social act. My work is completed by the viewer.\" And she turns this into a joke: \"Well, if no one was there to look at it ...\" - but it's true.Her 1960s paintings like Current (1964) with its warping black and white flow that suddenly tightens into a faster, shorter frequency at the centre, create rhythms whose power is more than poetic. Your eye is taken for a ride.Her art got more expansive, in the new industrial space. \"It gave me the chance to make big paintings.\" These paintings replaced the intense hallucinatory effects of her black-and-white works with kaleidoscopic colour. And here we are today, in a converted building in Mile End, where she still comes to work from her home in west London.She likes that distance between herself and work, she says. Painters are admired for expressing inner life, for subjective vision. Riley's art declares that another beauty, another power, exists not in private selves but in the dialogue between human beings. It is quintessentially an art born in the 60s and yet it is still truthful today. The social and collective vision of 1968, which she shared and realised through SPACE, is basic to her artistic vision.When you look at her paintings, you don't ponder them, you live them.You are set free by them: in this art the revolution continues."

        "text": "When Bridget Riley first started to make abstract paintings – beginning in 1961 with her chequerboard composition Movement in Squares – she banished colour from her art, using only black and white. It was six years later, in 1967, that she began introducing colour to her dazzling geometric compositions. This week, the painter, one of Britain's most revered living artists, has become the first Briton and the first woman to win the Sikkens prize, a Dutch award recognising the use of colour.Previous winners include US artist Donald Judd, but also the Paris street-cleaning department, \"for the consistent use of the colour green\", and, in the 1970s, hippies, \"for the exuberant use of colour as a playful aspect in human society\".In a rare interview, Riley, 81, spoke about the use of colour in her work, which was dubbed \"op art\", a pun on the pop art movement, in the 1960s. \"In my years after leaving art school, I found a way of learning about the use of use of colour in modern art by copying a Seurat,\" she said, referring to Georges Seurat's Bridge at Courbevoie, in the Courtauld Institute. \"It was the landscape of a river and its banks in autumn. I copied it from a reproduction, because it is much easier to copy when one is not intimidated by the presence of a masterwork. I learned lessons about how colours behave through interaction when placed next to each other.\"And then, on a very spectacular summer day looking over a valley near Siena, sparkling and shimmering in the heat, I made my own attempt. I made studies, and later, a painting. I was quite pleased, in fact, with what I'd been able to do, but it had nothing to do with what I had actually experienced in front of this landscape …\"So I decided to start again to find a new beginning – to start from the themes themselves, that is to say, shapes, lines, and so on. That led to my making a black-and-white painting and seeing what it would do: and it moved.\"That was Movement in Squares. The abstract works, in fact, began to possess some of the qualities Riley had discerned in that Tuscan heat haze: \"Movement, shimmering, sparkling and reflecting … all those things that happen in landscape.\"The apparently stern, self-imposed restrictions, such as the initial lack of colour and the gradual introduction of elements such as the curve, had been huge aids to her, she said. \"Too much freedom is terrifying. The first thing Stravinsky would do was to set himself limits in his work. If he still felt inhibited by freedom, he set himself more limits.\" In a 2009 essay for the London Review of Books, Riley quoted the composer's words: \"The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self of the chains that shackle the spirit.\"Asked about the difference between abstract and figurative art, she said: \"Many people would like to know how to look at abstract painting because they may be used to looking at figurative painting. But I personally believe they are all about painting itself. The big difference is conventions of looking.\" Certain arrangements of paint suggest figures or objects, she said, through tacitly agreed conventions – but in the end, all painting is about relationships of colour, shape and line, whether abstract or figurative.Abstraction and figuration, she said, share the capacity to offer a spiritual experience to the viewer. \"One of the most extraordinary things to look at is a painting of heaven and the celestial hosts and the mother of God – these are themes that artists gave as an experience of spiritual matters to their audience. In its best form, [abstract] painting offers a spiritual experience. It's very hard to define what that might precisely mean, and one shouldn't try.\"To mark the prize, an exhibition of Riley's art has opened at the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, including a new 20-metre wall painting executed by assistants, as is usual in her work. \"I hope people will find things in it to look at,\" she said. \"It has a variety of relationships, a variety of passages in it. There are things to find in it, I hope, just as there are in a landscape painting.\"Riley has long had a serious relationship with the Old Masters: one of her important student works was a copy of Jan van Eyck's Portrait of a Man, a possible self-portrait in which the sitter is dressed in a red turban, and, in 2010, the National Gallery held an exhibition setting her work alongside paintings by artists including Raphael and Mantegna.Asked about her impressions of the contemporary art scene of today – larger by far and more widely recognised by the public than when Riley began her career in the 1960s – she chose to talk about the Renaissance. \"Contemporary art is not a new thing,\" she said. \"Every period has its contemporary wing. In the Renaissance the practice of painting would have been a much bigger thing.\"Many people would have been painting, for religious works, for festivals, for processions; painting churches, carriages, chests, boats. There would have been an extraordinary amount of brushwork and decoration. These things furnished a platform for high art, as it were, but no one set out to be a fine artist. Some individuals simply raised their bar, or got more ambitious.

There are things to find in it, I hope, just as there are in a landscape painting.\"exhibitionRiley has long had a serious relationship with the Old Masters: one of her important student works was a copy of Jan van Eyck's Portrait of a Man, a possible self-portrait in which the sitter is dressed in a red turban, and, in 2010, the National Gallery held an exhibition setting her work alongside paintings by artists including Raphael and Mantegna.Portrait of a ManexhibitionAsked about her impressions of the contemporary art scene of today – larger by far and more widely recognised by the public than when Riley began her career in the 1960s – she chose to talk about the Renaissance. \"Contemporary art is not a new thing,\" she said. \"Every period has its contemporary wing. In the Renaissance the practice of painting would have been a much bigger thing.\"Many people would have been painting, for religious works, for festivals, for processions; painting churches, carriages, chests, boats. There would have been an extraordinary amount of brushwork and decoration. These things furnished a platform for high art, as it were, but no one set out to be a fine artist. Some individuals simply raised their bar, or got more ambitious. There will always be people born with talent, with gifts, with minds that seek new experiences, generation after generation.\""

        "text": "Bridget Riley is the most important British painter of the modern age. Bacon? Freud? Hockney? None of those famous men took hold of the language of painting and remade it as she has. Most of the artists we are nationally proud of are sideshow performers who dallied with figuration long after it was blown apart by Jackson Pollock. Abstraction is the true destiny of modern painting and Riley and Howard Hodgkin are Britain’s two great living exponents of it. If Hodgkin resembles a poet, Riley is more like a scientist. In the 1960s she revealed a revolution hidden in the human eye. To look at Riley’s 1964 painting Crest is to be sucked into a dazzling shimmering superstring universe. What has happened to reality? It has become a rushing cascade of black and white lines, warping in unison. The effect of this wave motion is to make the painting, as you approach it, move and expand. The brain cannot decipher what the eye sees. Instead of lines on a flat surface you experience a vertiginous plummeting waterfall of three dimensional space. People were of course trying all kinds of things to change their perceptions in 1964. As Danny the drug dealer explains in Withnail and I, “You have done something to your brain. You have made it high … Why trust one drug and not the other? That’s politics, innit?” That politics pervades Riley’s paintings not just in their psychedelic belief that we must see reality anew, as if for the first time, but also in their technocratic conviction that science can achieve this. Instead of a pill, she uses lines. Riley’s art is all about lines that cavort and dance, and lead the brain into their crazy pirouette. Bending reality: Study for Kiss, 1961 Bridget Riley She paints like an engineer of human minds. The colours she sends streaming through space are carefully planned to tease and unfix us. The loveliest part of her exhibition at the De La Warr Pavilion is a selection of drawings in which she precisely and exquisitely maps out on graph paper the exact patterns she wants to paint. When Riley later met the art historian EH Gombrich, whose famous book Art and Illusion is a study of how we see and represent reality, they got on famously. Although she has no scientific training her art – as Gombrich, who generally distrusted modern art, recognised – is a serious investigation of the nature of perception. To understand why Riley is such a huge original you need to compare these drawings – for instance Untitled (Right Angle Curve) (1966) which plots a typically eye-flummoxing whoosh of black lines – with the great American abstract painters who had transformed art after the second world war. The open, expansive work of Pollock and Barnett Newman speaks in a grand way to the soul. Riley’s graphs laugh at the very idea of a soul. Speaking to the soul? It’s optics, man. You do something to your brain. It’s not a romantic mystery. It’s doctoring the eye. Riley took on the greatest and most revolutionary art of her time and turned its assumptions upside down. Revelation is not a rare attainment available only to a spiritual elite, her paintings assert, but a democratic right that science can deliver. We all see the same way and we can all have our minds blown wide open by the same optical effects. Not one of Bridget Riley’s paintings from the 1960s and 70s in this exhibition fails to work that magic. You don’t passively contemplate these paintings. You are changed by them. The world alters its nature. Flat surfaces become mountain ranges, rolling rivers, waterfalls. The space in front of the picture and behind it seems to vibrate, grow, shrink and twist. Colours made their entry, adding to the intoxicating mayhem, as the 60s crested towards the 70s. Spending time with Riley’s painting Song of Orpheus 3 (1978) is like visiting the Alhambra drunk. Her feel for pattern and sensuality of colour is delirously Moorish. Her paintings express the hopes of the sixties: Untitled [Turquoise and red curves], 1968 by Bridget Riley But a few years after this, the wave breaks, hits the shore and rolls back. Riley is a revolutionary artist, and revolutions come to an end. When I say she is our most important painter I mean she has transformed and reimagined what painting can be. She did this in an age of radical change and optimism. It is impossible not to see Riley as a visionary of the 1960s whose art unfolds a new and liberating way of seeing. Forget pop art. It is Riley’s sublime “op art” that really expresses the hopes and possibilities of the 60s and their tie-dyed 70s aftermath. It is tempting to see her later art as expressing its time, too. This exhibition is called The Curve Paintings 1961-2014 and it follows one kind of line – a curvy one – through Riley’s art over more than five decades. But in the 1980s the curve broke – literally. Instead of endless universal waves her later paintings use more jagged, fragmentary and cubistic forms. The flow ceases. She does not gather you in but invites you to look. You stand apart, contemplating formidable and beautiful – but no longer dynamic, delirious or mind-blowing – colours. Riley’s early paintings are American in their Pollock-like, rollercoaster sense of space, and the way they are not designed like pictures within a frame but seem to invisibly carry on over the edges of the canvas – what American critics at the time called “all over” painting, and rightly saw as tremendously liberating. Her later ones are proudly European. They grandly enjoy their place in the history of modern European art, and consciously evoke the broken light of Seurat. While her early works have a Manhattanite sense of urgency, her later ones make me imagine her communing with Matisse after a good lunch in Provence.It strikes me that Riley’s art in the 1980s lost its belief in change, revolution and oneness.

        "text": "When I first came to London in 1963, Bridget Riley's career was just taking off. Two years later a notorious exhibition in New York made her an overnight celebrity worldwide. Even before that she stood out from her contemporaries. She was one of 12 exhibitors in the first New Generation show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1964, a sensational series that launched a whole wave of young British artists long before YBA became a global trademark. The other 11 (including David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield and Allen Jones) contributed sober purposeful personal statements to the catalogue. Riley wrote simply: \"1+1 equals one.\"Urgent, fierce and enigmatic, her work in those days carried undertones of menace and aggression. She said she made the first of her black-and-white paintings in 1960 as \"an extreme statement of something violent\". Shock and anger were a common response. Her early canvases hurt people's eyes and made them dizzy. Even their titles – Shiver, Current, Blaze, Burn – spelt danger. One was initially called Discharge because it aimed to transfix the spectator, \"like arrows being discharged in your face as you looked at it\".The painting (later renamed Static) consists of a vast number of flat black dots evenly spaced on a large white canvas that looks in close-up as cool, light and summery as the dotted voile dress in Monet's Lady with a Parasol, or Matisse's billowing muslin curtains in Harmony in Yellow. All three works were painted with the same subversive intent. Riley set out explicitly to dislodge prejudice and disturb perception. Static is on one level a visual ultimatum, a manifesto embodying in the plainest possible terms the dismantling of traditional barriers – social, cultural and in this case pictorial – that was a prime goal of the 60s.It is hard to credit today what Riley called the \"infectious apathy and vicious insularity\" of the postwar British art scene. There were hardly any artbooks, no glossy magazines, no media interest, no travelling exhibitions and virtually nowhere for contemporary artists to exhibit. Growing up in provincial Bristol in the 1950s, I had only dimly heard of something called modern art. It was a butt for adult jokes about female nudes with holes in, or priapic hairy men with both eyes on the same side of their noses. Apart from that, all I had to go on was a postcard of an abstract painting by Ben Nicholson, and a cast of Reg Butler's Unknown Political Prisoner in Bristol Art Gallery. We knew even less about contemporary art than we did about sex in that repressive and inhibited decade.To me as a schoolgirl the local art students, like the teddy boys in winklepickers, padded drapes and quiffy hairdos, seemed the last word in sophistication. But Riley herself said later that, in five years at art school, no one ever told her that art didn't come to a full stop with the surrealists in the 1930s. The pent-up energy of the intervening years burst out finally in the destructive and creative whirlwind of the 60s, \"an explosion\", in Riley's words, \"of optimism and confidence, elation and drive\".These were very different sensations from the optimism of the current generation of YBAs, who look back in bemusement – as Damien Hirst said recently – to a bygone era when art was made for its own sake without taking any account of commercial dealers. \"I found my way in daydreams,\" said Riley. \"It never occurred to me that I could earn my living as an artist.\" She was frankly appalled by the celebrity that overtook her so dramatically in 1965. Landing in New York for the opening of the Museum of Modern Art's group show, The Responsive Eye, she drove in from the airport down Madison Avenue, past shops filled with dresses based on one of her own paintings (\"my heart sank\"). The Riley craze proved unstoppable. Everything from shopfronts to lampshades and desk accessories came in juddering, pulsing, vertiginous black-and-white zigzags, swells and curves. \"We'll have you on the back of every matchbox in Japan,\" said a triumphant trustee at MoMA. Feeling violated and outraged, Riley tried to sue (a bill establishing artists' copyright in their own work in the US was passed a year later as a direct consequence of this public dustup).But what struck her as a monstrous assault at the time was also in its way a crude, gaudy, mocking tribute. In retrospect that encounter on Madison Avenue looks like one of those sudden perceptual shifts that jolted the 20th century whenever people began to get the hang of a new way of seeing. Riley was consumed from the start by the mysterious workings of air, light, motion, vision itself. Her early paintings don't so much catch movement as seem to move themselves in glittering dots released like a flight of arrows from the surface of the canvas, in great drifts of finely graded discs that oscillate and shimmer like wind on water, in curving bands of black alternating with different shades of grey that sway at the edges in the corner of your eye like reeds in lapping water.The last two canvases, Black to White Discs of 1962 and Arrest 3 of 1965, are among the earliest paintings in the National Gallery's new small show in its Sunley Room, Bridget Riley: Paintings and Related Work. The exhibition is designed as a dialogue between her work and some of the paintings in the gallery (by Mantegna, Rubens and Seurat) that speak the same language. It emphasises a continuity that may seem self-evident now but certainly didn't then. I well remember the initial shock of seeing 20 or so of Riley's first colour paintings hanging together at the Hayward in 1971. There was a sense of almost orgiastic release transmitted with extreme composure by those massed ranks of scarlet, blue and emerald, sharp pinks and pale translucent greens, orange streaking along broad straight strips of black. \"Stranger still are the colours escaping from these paintings,\" I wrote at the time, \"imaginary colours, greens that come and go, yellows floating in thin air, flying across or shooting out like flames from the surface of a canvas.\"Riley let loose the colours traditionally confined to the painted surface, \"like an animal behind bars\", said Bryan Robertson, who chose and hung that show. Her work operates energetically in an indefinable area somewhere between the painting and the viewer where light glows and flickers in rhythmic transformations, transpositions and variations, a process closer to music than to conventional painting. Colour at this pitch makes traditional subject matter irrelevant. Riley's subject is something so transient and unstable that it vanishes as soon as you look closely. \"What you focus upon is not what you see,\" said Riley. \"One looks here and colour is there.\" Her paintings work only as an active collaboration between artist and viewer. \"One moment there will be nothing to look at and the next second the canvas suddenly seems to refill, to be crowded with visual events.\"The same rule applies to other painters of all kinds and periods who sometimes speak to you, and sometimes don't. Just over 20 years ago Riley curated another show at the National Gallery, The Colour Connection in a series called The Artist's Eye. She chose seven paintings from the collection, and analysed them so brilliantly that reading her catalogue text made you see in quite unexpected ways what those painters saw. It was like overhearing a vivid, detailed, intimate conversation between fellow practitioners about work in progress. \"The way he uses his diagonals tells one a great deal about his reasoning,\" she wrote of Poussin's Adoration of the Kings. Riley seems to be confronting her own problems here, and again when she examines the diagonal structure of Veronese's Adoration of the Kings, a composition bisected by a slanting shaft of light, slight and filmy but \"strong enough to swing the entire movement of the Adoration in a slow arc – like the clapper of a great bell\". The reader learns as much about Riley's current work from these discussions as about El Greco's use of grey to bed down his colours, or the way Tiepolo relied on distance to diffuse the radiance of a painted ceiling.She explains in terms available only to another painter how Rubens generates light in the Allegory of Peace \"by building up a grid or lattice around which he can twist or through which he can pour his colours . . . Making use of his lattice he twines a long curving garland of yellows down and across the painting . . . although it may be hair, metal, fruit, clouds or skin, Rubens disposes it quite logically\". Reconstructing Rubens an abstract artist makes his work look as if it had been painted yesterday. The collapse of traditional disciplines and beliefs means, as Riley often says, that an artist today has to invent his or her own context as well as the criteria to judge it by. But the loss of a supportive system that had become increasingly oppressive can also give power and possibility, including the freedom to negotiate fresh terms with the past.The earliest picture in the current show is a copy made in 1949, the year after Riley left school, of Van Eyck's Man with a Red Turban. The most recent is a colossal, still provisional work, Composition with Circles 7, the latest in a series of wall paintings going back to 1997. Drawn in black directly on the white wall of the gallery, the series looks back to her black-and-white beginnings and (like them), has had surprising coloured repercussions. Majestic works such as Red with Red 1 (2007) in the current show regain the simplicity and stability of Kiss (1961), an electrifying canvas whose massive black parabola intersecting with a mighty band of black suggests a curved section of the earth's surface making temporary contact with another planetary body.Riley's work over the past decade has infiltrated and engulfed whole walls, putting out overlapping, interleaving feelers to minimise the distance between painting and viewer. Composition with Circles 7 is made up, like others in the same series, of circles roughly a metre wide that enfold the spectator within an airy labyrinth of curved and echoing spaces. They remind me – as Riley's work so often has in recent years – of Henri Matisse, another painter whose colour was compared by his contemporaries to a wild beast set free. Matisse, like Riley, aimed to clarify, liberate and restore to painting its central emotional charge, something he triumphantly achieved in the last years of his life when his cut-paper collages took over their environment, invading walls and filling the space around them with disembodied flying colour.No art critic or art historian of her generation has done as much as Riley to dismantle the barrier between the present and the past, as Nicholas Penny points out in the catalogue for the new show. This is the latest instalment in a passionate, complex lifelong exchange. \"They're so alive! They're like people,\" Riley said, discussing the National Gallery's paintings 20 years ago with Neil MacGregor. \"They have moods, they're not static . . . a painting will reveal itself as a personality does, slowly after many visits.\" The violent iconoclastic impulse that drove her 50 years ago was only another form of the urge to strip away the conventional prejudices and visual preconceptions that make it so hard today to look clearly at the paintings of the past. Riley's is the simplest, oldest and most basic reason for making art. \"My aim is to make people feel alive.\"Bridget Riley: Paintings and Related Work is at the National Gallery, London, until 22 May 2011.When I first came to London in 1963, Bridget Riley's career was just taking off.

The other 11 (including David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield and Allen Jones) contributed sober purposeful personal statements to the catalogue. Riley wrote simply: \"1+1 equals one.\"Urgent, fierce and enigmatic, her work in those days carried undertones of menace and aggression. She said she made the first of her black-and-white paintings in 1960 as \"an extreme statement of something violent\". Shock and anger were a common response. Her early canvases hurt people's eyes and made them dizzy. Even their titles – Shiver, Current, Blaze, Burn – spelt danger. One was initially called Discharge because it aimed to transfix the spectator, \"like arrows being discharged in your face as you looked at it\".The painting (later renamed Static) consists of a vast number of flat black dots evenly spaced on a large white canvas that looks in close-up as cool, light and summery as the dotted voile dress in Monet's Lady with a Parasol, or Matisse's billowing muslin curtains in Harmony in Yellow. All three works were painted with the same subversive intent. Riley set out explicitly to dislodge prejudice and disturb perception. Static is on one level a visual ultimatum, a manifesto embodying in the plainest possible terms the dismantling of traditional barriers – social, cultural and in this case pictorial – that was a prime goal of the 60s.It is hard to credit today what Riley called the \"infectious apathy and vicious insularity\" of the postwar British art scene. There were hardly any artbooks, no glossy magazines, no media interest, no travelling exhibitions and virtually nowhere for contemporary artists to exhibit. Growing up in provincial Bristol in the 1950s, I had only dimly heard of something called modern art. It was a butt for adult jokes about female nudes with holes in, or priapic hairy men with both eyes on the same side of their noses. Apart from that, all I had to go on was a postcard of an abstract painting by Ben Nicholson, and a cast of Reg Butler's Unknown Political Prisoner in Bristol Art Gallery. We knew even less about contemporary art than we did about sex in that repressive and inhibited decade.To me as a schoolgirl the local art students, like the teddy boys in winklepickers, padded drapes and quiffy hairdos, seemed the last word in sophistication. But Riley herself said later that, in five years at art school, no one ever told her that art didn't come to a full stop with the surrealists in the 1930s. The pent-up energy of the intervening years burst out finally in the destructive and creative whirlwind of the 60s, \"an explosion\", in Riley's words, \"of optimism and confidence, elation and drive\".These were very different sensations from the optimism of the current generation of YBAs, who look back in bemusement – as Damien Hirst said recently – to a bygone era when art was made for its own sake without taking any account of commercial dealers. \"I found my way in daydreams,\" said Riley. \"It never occurred to me that I could earn my living as an artist.\" She was frankly appalled by the celebrity that overtook her so dramatically in 1965. Landing in New York for the opening of the Museum of Modern Art's group show, The Responsive Eye, she drove in from the airport down Madison Avenue, past shops filled with dresses based on one of her own paintings (\"my heart sank\"). The Riley craze proved unstoppable. Everything from shopfronts to lampshades and desk accessories came in juddering, pulsing, vertiginous black-and-white zigzags, swells and curves. \"We'll have you on the back of every matchbox in Japan,\" said a triumphant trustee at MoMA. Feeling violated and outraged, Riley tried to sue (a bill establishing artists' copyright in their own work in the US was passed a year later as a direct consequence of this public dustup).But what struck her as a monstrous assault at the time was also in its way a crude, gaudy, mocking tribute. In retrospect that encounter on Madison Avenue looks like one of those sudden perceptual shifts that jolted the 20th century whenever people began to get the hang of a new way of seeing. Riley was consumed from the start by the mysterious workings of air, light, motion, vision itself. Her early paintings don't so much catch movement as seem to move themselves in glittering dots released like a flight of arrows from the surface of the canvas, in great drifts of finely graded discs that oscillate and shimmer like wind on water, in curving bands of black alternating with different shades of grey that sway at the edges in the corner of your eye like reeds in lapping water.The last two canvases, Black to White Discs of 1962 and Arrest 3 of 1965, are among the earliest paintings in the National Gallery's new small show in its Sunley Room, Bridget Riley: Paintings and Related Work. The exhibition is designed as a dialogue between her work and some of the paintings in the gallery (by Mantegna, Rubens and Seurat) that speak the same language. It emphasises a continuity that may seem self-evident now but certainly didn't then. I well remember the initial shock of seeing 20 or so of Riley's first colour paintings hanging together at the Hayward in 1971. There was a sense of almost orgiastic release transmitted with extreme composure by those massed ranks of scarlet, blue and emerald, sharp pinks and pale translucent greens, orange streaking along broad straight strips of black. \"Stranger still are the colours escaping from these paintings,\" I wrote at the time, \"imaginary colours, greens that come and go, yellows floating in thin air, flying across or shooting out like flames from the surface of a canvas.\"Riley let loose the colours traditionally confined to the painted surface, \"like an animal behind bars\", said Bryan Robertson, who chose and hung that show. Her work operates energetically in an indefinable area somewhere between the painting and the viewer where light glows and flickers in rhythmic transformations, transpositions and variations, a process closer to music than to conventional painting. Colour at this pitch makes traditional subject matter irrelevant. Riley's subject is something so transient and unstable that it vanishes as soon as you look closely. \"What you focus upon is not what you see,\" said Riley. \"One looks here and colour is there.\" Her paintings work only as an active collaboration between artist and viewer. \"One moment there will be nothing to look at and the next second the canvas suddenly seems to refill, to be crowded with visual events.\"The same rule applies to other painters of all kinds and periods who sometimes speak to you, and sometimes don't. Just over 20 years ago Riley curated another show at the National Gallery, The Colour Connection in a series called The Artist's Eye. She chose seven paintings from the collection, and analysed them so brilliantly that reading her catalogue text made you see in quite unexpected ways what those painters saw. It was like overhearing a vivid, detailed, intimate conversation between fellow practitioners about work in progress. \"The way he uses his diagonals tells one a great deal about his reasoning,\" she wrote of Poussin's Adoration of the Kings. Riley seems to be confronting her own problems here, and again when she examines the diagonal structure of Veronese's Adoration of the Kings, a composition bisected by a slanting shaft of light, slight and filmy but \"strong enough to swing the entire movement of the Adoration in a slow arc – like the clapper of a great bell\". The reader learns as much about Riley's current work from these discussions as about El Greco's use of grey to bed down his colours, or the way Tiepolo relied on distance to diffuse the radiance of a painted ceiling.She explains in terms available only to another painter how Rubens generates light in the Allegory of Peace \"by building up a grid or lattice around which he can twist or through which he can pour his colours . . . Making use of his lattice he twines a long curving garland of yellows down and across the painting . . . although it may be hair, metal, fruit, clouds or skin, Rubens disposes it quite logically\". Reconstructing Rubens an abstract artist makes his work look as if it had been painted yesterday. The collapse of traditional disciplines and beliefs means, as Riley often says, that an artist today has to invent his or her own context as well as the criteria to judge it by. But the loss of a supportive system that had become increasingly oppressive can also give power and possibility, including the freedom to negotiate fresh terms with the past.The earliest picture in the current show is a copy made in 1949, the year after Riley left school, of Van Eyck's Man with a Red Turban. The most recent is a colossal, still provisional work, Composition with Circles 7, the latest in a series of wall paintings going back to 1997. Drawn in black directly on the white wall of the gallery, the series looks back to her black-and-white beginnings and (like them), has had surprising coloured repercussions. Majestic works such as Red with Red 1 (2007) in the current show regain the simplicity and stability of Kiss (1961), an electrifying canvas whose massive black parabola intersecting with a mighty band of black suggests a curved section of the earth's surface making temporary contact with another planetary body.Riley's work over the past decade has infiltrated and engulfed whole walls, putting out overlapping, interleaving feelers to minimise the distance between painting and viewer. Composition with Circles 7 is made up, like others in the same series, of circles roughly a metre wide that enfold the spectator within an airy labyrinth of curved and echoing spaces. They remind me – as Riley's work so often has in recent years – of Henri Matisse, another painter whose colour was compared by his contemporaries to a wild beast set free. Matisse, like Riley, aimed to clarify, liberate and restore to painting its central emotional charge, something he triumphantly achieved in the last years of his life when his cut-paper collages took over their environment, invading walls and filling the space around them with disembodied flying colour.No art critic or art historian of her generation has done as much as Riley to dismantle the barrier between the present and the past, as Nicholas Penny points out in the catalogue for the new show. This is the latest instalment in a passionate, complex lifelong exchange. \"They're so alive! They're like people,\" Riley said, discussing the National Gallery's paintings 20 years ago with Neil MacGregor. \"They have moods, they're not static . . . a painting will reveal itself as a personality does, slowly after many visits.\" The violent iconoclastic impulse that drove her 50 years ago was only another form of the urge to strip away the conventional prejudices and visual preconceptions that make it so hard today to look clearly at the paintings of the past. Riley's is the simplest, oldest and most basic reason for making art. \"My aim is to make people feel alive.\"Bridget Riley: Paintings and Related Work is at the National Gallery, London, until 22 May 2011.When I first came to London in 1963, Bridget Riley's career was just taking off.

        "text": "If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley, let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole 1960s Op art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of contemporary painting. Her first show in New York sold out before it opened. But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was considered the same as ambition.In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she was one of the stars of a big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw - in one store window after another - dresses by a variety of makers whose designs were lifted from her paintings. \"The whole thing had spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,\" she recalled years later. She was horrified and tried to sue. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note, eye-teasing stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping into oblivion. \"It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks at my paintings seriously again,\" Riley predicted. It took more than 30, in the US at least. But now abstract art is accepted in art's inner circles again. The art of the 1960s is being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art. Besides, the work looks great. The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of her career in the Lake District earned rave reviews in the London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her 1960s and 1970s pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her, attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there. Now, two galleries in New York are showing her work, from the 1960s to the 1980s. At 69, Riley is finally receiving her long-deserved second look. Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice. A distant descendant of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she describes as \"not badly off but not wealthy, either.\" She spent the war in a cottage in Cornwall with her mother, sister and aunt. Her aunt had studied art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several fortunes, was \"very visually aware\", she says. During the war years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the countryside in Cornwall. Talking about different light effects and the intricate characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence. Riley's father, a British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced labour on the Siamese railway but took a while to readapt to family life. \"He had learned to live in a self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,\" she says. In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied for three years, getting no guidance from the old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at the London art scene - small, male, conservative and insular - which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Riley helped to nurse him for a year, and the combined stress of that and trying to become a painter caused a nervous breakdown. Briefly hospitalised, she fell into a job at the J Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift. Then, in 1958, she went to a Jackson Pollock show in London that, she says, \"made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear that modern art was alive and I had something to react to\". The next year, she began an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older painter and innovative teacher whose interest in Klee, Cézanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark that you find what you love only by first giving it up. \"I wrongly attached to this person everything that I had experienced with him, which was the history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when I'd lost him, I'd lost that,\" she says. \"I decided to paint one last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small voice which looked at the painting and said: 'This doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of light. That was Kiss. It seemed good. And so I told myself, 'OK, just one more painting.' I was off.\" Kiss led to the early black-and-white Op works such as Movement in Squares. In 1960, Riley, still working at the ad agency, was dodging a downpour on the way home one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in, offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction. Then, at the peak of her fame, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to London. In Riley's six-storey Kensington house, four storeys are studios. Riley also has houses with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow in London's east end, a loft, with apartments she uses for storage. Riley has never married. She has no children. A few of her latest pictures are here: vividly coloured multi-panel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way. In the mid-1960s she realised that the effects she achieved in black and white already implied colours. From simple patterned stripes in basic colours such as red and blue, she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colours, which she found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early 1980s now) to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient Egyptians, using just a few colours, had conveyed the effect of what she has called the \"light-mirroring desert\". The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works, still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less dizzying planes of interlocking colours. Riley has always hated it when people say her works are hard on the eyes or create optical illusions, because it implies that they're just tricks - once seen, no longer interesting. Even so, her art can be tough to look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up. With a classic stripe painting such as Apres-Midi (1981), the stripes seem magically to unfold into depth. Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at irregular intervals. The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is about as good as traditional abstract painting gets. Since the early 1960s, assistants have carried out her pictures based on her preparatory drawings or on the works she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and strange. It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op art. The US, nationalistically myopic, mostly stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing to sell through the mid-1970s. She remained a formidable presence in British art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting prize at the Venice Biennale. Still, it was becoming more difficult for her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called London School of figurative painters, men like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and RB Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally with contemporary British art. She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her guns. In the early 1990s, you could buy a classic 1960s Riley drawing at Christie's in New York for $1,500 and a 1960s painting for $20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000. Riley's up-and-down status has always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the 1960s, it was that she was associated with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now, it's postfeminism, postmodernism and 1960s retro chic. When Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room to Riley, another clear sign of changed times. \"Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets the upper hand it spells a vacuum,\" she says. \"During the periods of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.\" © 2000 Michael Kimmelman. Kimmelman is chief art critic of the New York Times.If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley, let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole 1960s Op art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of contemporary painting. Her first show in New York sold out before it opened. But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was considered the same as ambition.In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she was one of the stars of a big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw - in one store window after another - dresses by a variety of makers whose designs were lifted from her paintings. \"The whole thing had spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,\" she recalled years later. She was horrified and tried to sue. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note, eye-teasing stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping into oblivion. \"It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks at my paintings seriously again,\" Riley predicted. It took more than 30, in the US at least. But now abstract art is accepted in art's inner circles again. The art of the 1960s is being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art. Besides, the work looks great. The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of her career in the Lake District earned rave reviews in the London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her 1960s and 1970s pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her, attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there. Now, two galleries in New York are showing her work, from the 1960s to the 1980s. At 69, Riley is finally receiving her long-deserved second look. Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice. A distant descendant of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she describes as \"not badly off but not wealthy, either.\" She spent the war in a cottage in Cornwall with her mother, sister and aunt. Her aunt had studied art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several fortunes, was \"very visually aware\", she says. During the war years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the countryside in Cornwall. Talking about different light effects and the intricate characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence. Riley's father, a British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced labour on the Siamese railway but took a while to readapt to family life. \"He had learned to live in a self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,\" she says. In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied for three years, getting no guidance from the old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at the London art scene - small, male, conservative and insular - which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Riley helped to nurse him for a year, and the combined stress of that and trying to become a painter caused a nervous breakdown. Briefly hospitalised, she fell into a job at the J Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift. Then, in 1958, she went to a Jackson Pollock show in London that, she says, \"made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear that modern art was alive and I had something to react to\". The next year, she began an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older painter and innovative teacher whose interest in Klee, Cézanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark that you find what you love only by first giving it up. \"I wrongly attached to this person everything that I had experienced with him, which was the history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when I'd lost him, I'd lost that,\" she says. \"I decided to paint one last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small voice which looked at the painting and said: 'This doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of light. That was Kiss. It seemed good. And so I told myself, 'OK, just one more painting.' I was off.\" Kiss led to the early black-and-white Op works such as Movement in Squares. In 1960, Riley, still working at the ad agency, was dodging a downpour on the way home one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in, offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction. Then, at the peak of her fame, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to London. In Riley's six-storey Kensington house, four storeys are studios. Riley also has houses with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow in London's east end, a loft, with apartments she uses for storage. Riley has never married. She has no children. A few of her latest pictures are here: vividly coloured multi-panel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way. In the mid-1960s she realised that the effects she achieved in black and white already implied colours. From simple patterned stripes in basic colours such as red and blue, she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colours, which she found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early 1980s now) to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient Egyptians, using just a few colours, had conveyed the effect of what she has called the \"light-mirroring desert\". The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works, still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less dizzying planes of interlocking colours. Riley has always hated it when people say her works are hard on the eyes or create optical illusions, because it implies that they're just tricks - once seen, no longer interesting. Even so, her art can be tough to look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up. With a classic stripe painting such as Apres-Midi (1981), the stripes seem magically to unfold into depth. Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at irregular intervals. The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is about as good as traditional abstract painting gets. Since the early 1960s, assistants have carried out her pictures based on her preparatory drawings or on the works she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and strange. It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op art. The US, nationalistically myopic, mostly stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing to sell through the mid-1970s. She remained a formidable presence in British art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting prize at the Venice Biennale. Still, it was becoming more difficult for her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called London School of figurative painters, men like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and RB Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally with contemporary British art. She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her guns. In the early 1990s, you could buy a classic 1960s Riley drawing at Christie's in New York for $1,500 and a 1960s painting for $20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000. Riley's up-and-down status has always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the 1960s, it was that she was associated with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now, it's postfeminism, postmodernism and 1960s retro chic. When Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room to Riley, another clear sign of changed times. \"Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets the upper hand it spells a vacuum,\" she says. \"During the periods of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or distractions.

Now, two galleries in New York are showing her work, from the 1960s to the 1980s. At 69, Riley is finally receiving her long-deserved second look. Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice. A distant descendant of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she describes as \"not badly off but not wealthy, either.\" She spent the war in a cottage in Cornwall with her mother, sister and aunt. Her aunt had studied art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several fortunes, was \"very visually aware\", she says. During the war years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the countryside in Cornwall. Talking about different light effects and the intricate characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence. Riley's father, a British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced labour on the Siamese railway but took a while to readapt to family life. \"He had learned to live in a self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,\" she says. In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied for three years, getting no guidance from the old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at the London art scene - small, male, conservative and insular - which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Riley helped to nurse him for a year, and the combined stress of that and trying to become a painter caused a nervous breakdown. Briefly hospitalised, she fell into a job at the J Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift. Then, in 1958, she went to a Jackson Pollock show in London that, she says, \"made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear that modern art was alive and I had something to react to\". The next year, she began an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older painter and innovative teacher whose interest in Klee, Cézanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark that you find what you love only by first giving it up. \"I wrongly attached to this person everything that I had experienced with him, which was the history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when I'd lost him, I'd lost that,\" she says. \"I decided to paint one last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small voice which looked at the painting and said: 'This doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of light. That was Kiss. It seemed good. And so I told myself, 'OK, just one more painting.' I was off.\" Kiss led to the early black-and-white Op works such as Movement in Squares. In 1960, Riley, still working at the ad agency, was dodging a downpour on the way home one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in, offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction. Then, at the peak of her fame, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to London. In Riley's six-storey Kensington house, four storeys are studios. Riley also has houses with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow in London's east end, a loft, with apartments she uses for storage. Riley has never married. She has no children. A few of her latest pictures are here: vividly coloured multi-panel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way. In the mid-1960s she realised that the effects she achieved in black and white already implied colours. From simple patterned stripes in basic colours such as red and blue, she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colours, which she found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early 1980s now) to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient Egyptians, using just a few colours, had conveyed the effect of what she has called the \"light-mirroring desert\". The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works, still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less dizzying planes of interlocking colours. Riley has always hated it when people say her works are hard on the eyes or create optical illusions, because it implies that they're just tricks - once seen, no longer interesting. Even so, her art can be tough to look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up. With a classic stripe painting such as Apres-Midi (1981), the stripes seem magically to unfold into depth. Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at irregular intervals. The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is about as good as traditional abstract painting gets. Since the early 1960s, assistants have carried out her pictures based on her preparatory drawings or on the works she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and strange. It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op art. The US, nationalistically myopic, mostly stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing to sell through the mid-1970s. She remained a formidable presence in British art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting prize at the Venice Biennale. Still, it was becoming more difficult for her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called London School of figurative painters, men like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and RB Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally with contemporary British art. She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her guns. In the early 1990s, you could buy a classic 1960s Riley drawing at Christie's in New York for $1,500 and a 1960s painting for $20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000. Riley's up-and-down status has always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the 1960s, it was that she was associated with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now, it's postfeminism, postmodernism and 1960s retro chic. When Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room to Riley, another clear sign of changed times. \"Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets the upper hand it spells a vacuum,\" she says. \"During the periods of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.\" © 2000 Michael Kimmelman.

        "text": "The dazzle of sunlight on waves is nearly impossible to paint. Everything is in flux. Art has its fixed conventions, of course, from asterisks and zigzags to blank white patches that are supposed to get across the blinding effect of so much brilliance. But it always feels as if the vision is frozen. The play of light on water as a living phenomenon, scintillating, volatile, ever-changing – this is evoked as nowhere else in a painting by Bridget Riley.What you see is a diamond-shaped array of discs on a square white canvas. These discs shift from pale grey to black, in the centre, and then gradually onwards to grey again. As the eye moves across the range, attracted by this supple furling and unfurling, each disc sends up its own bright after-image. Sequins of light rise, scatter and then fade. The permutations are beautiful, and they are endless.Close up, what's more, each disc radiates a coldly glowing halo like a star. Stand further away and the painting seems to swell and shimmer. There are vast and elemental associations here; and there are tiny incidents on the scale of fireworks and spangled waves, and all sustained with little more than tonal variation and geometry. This painting does not depict light – it generates light in itself, and celebrates our perception of it. For all these visions are brought to mind by the movement of our own eyes.Black to White Discs (1962) deserves its place in the National Gallery, and not just because Bridget Riley is rightly regarded as a great classicist. So many contemporary painters invited to exhibit here have displayed weak pastiches or homages to the old masters. Her work stands proud and original.For Riley, the gallery has been \"the book in which we learn to read\", to adapt Cézanne's description of the Louvre. The first work here is her 1949 copy of Jan van Eyck's self-portrait; among the latest is Arcadia I, which appears suffused with the free blue air of Cézanne's Les Grandes Baigneuses, though here the reading has surely ended.Indeed the curious effect of this tremendous show, in which Riley's paintings are displayed alongside permanent works from the collection, is that it makes you see past art anew. Look at her suave ripples and you suddenly realise how Mantegna makes his frieze of figures appear to move continuously in both directions. Look at Riley and you may better appreciate the abstract qualities of Raphael.These old-new pairings soon give way to what is effectively a miniature retrospective – early op-art, 80s stripes, the recent parallel curves and steeply flaring diagonals, cross-cut by verticals. The main gallery is all Riley, and dominated by an immense mural composed of interlinking circles, approximately one metre across, in blazing black on white. Tightly plotted, yet open-ended, it sends the eye round and around in every direction, following the tracery, drawn by particular rhythms, distracted by sparking intersections; a movement as unpredictable as mercury.The means are simple and perspicuous, but the effect is indefinable. No other painting in the National Gallery makes you more aware of the spherical form of the eye, of its gliding sweeps and rotations. The mural doesn't just describe them – though there is always the sense that Riley is painting perception itself – it actually orchestrates these limitless motions.Nothing seen ever stands still, and not in her art either. Black and white vibrate and effervesce. Curves reach a pinnacle and then twist back on themselves. Sheaves of coloured stripes undulate and sway, each acting on the next in a chain reaction only just contained by the rectangle of the canvas. A blue in the middle makes the eye swing sideways, a hue at the edge glows just enough to stop the eye from exiting the painting.For obviously there are limits. The canvas is a restricted plane, after all, and Riley's methods are highly refined, each developing from the one before. She quotes Stravinsky in the catalogue \"My freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action.\"Her workings are all on show. Anyone so inclined can measure the stripes, deduce the colour principles that dictate atmosphere, motion and speed, perhaps even produce a diagram of the system of curves and verticals in her recent works. Which pink is it that creates that haze? Is it the mauve or the brown that subdues the mood? You could learn as much – more – about the character and behaviour of paint from looking at Riley as Raphael.But all this precision is countered by the direct experience of the paintings (the potential of which, alas, is not available in reproduction). You can count the stripes, you may even be able to guess what constitutes a warp and a weft in her most dizzyingly complicated compositions, but once the eye is in there it loses hold of what is going on.Take Arcadia 1, not just the masterpiece of this show but one of Riley's greatest works. Green and white and corn and a beautiful variation of cobalt, it is painted directly on the wall. The blue appears to act as a steadying backdrop, but then it leaps forward, taking part in the intersection of curves, verticals and diagonals that create a whole pageant of shapes: leaves, kites, twisting ribbons, the dipping hooves of merry-go-round horses. There is no stopping place, every element is designed, and combined, to send the eye flowing onwards.What you find in this painting may involve music, ballet or ships in full sail. It might have something to do with the seasons, landscape, sunlight or water, as pastoral as the title suggests – common subjects of the National Gallery.But this picture is not figurative. It depicts none of these things. So how does it conjure them all? What Riley offers is an infinite variety of optical experiences, of vitality, freedom, elation. Ultimately the painting appears to float free of the wall itself, nothing pinned down: as open to the eye as the imagination.The dazzle of sunlight on waves is nearly impossible to paint.

The mural doesn't just describe them – though there is always the sense that Riley is painting perception itself – it actually orchestrates these limitless motions.Nothing seen ever stands still, and not in her art either. Black and white vibrate and effervesce. Curves reach a pinnacle and then twist back on themselves. Sheaves of coloured stripes undulate and sway, each acting on the next in a chain reaction only just contained by the rectangle of the canvas. A blue in the middle makes the eye swing sideways, a hue at the edge glows just enough to stop the eye from exiting the painting.For obviously there are limits. The canvas is a restricted plane, after all, and Riley's methods are highly refined, each developing from the one before. She quotes Stravinsky in the catalogue \"My freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action.\"Her workings are all on show. Anyone so inclined can measure the stripes, deduce the colour principles that dictate atmosphere, motion and speed, perhaps even produce a diagram of the system of curves and verticals in her recent works. Which pink is it that creates that haze? Is it the mauve or the brown that subdues the mood? You could learn as much – more – about the character and behaviour of paint from looking at Riley as Raphael.But all this precision is countered by the direct experience of the paintings (the potential of which, alas, is not available in reproduction). You can count the stripes, you may even be able to guess what constitutes a warp and a weft in her most dizzyingly complicated compositions, but once the eye is in there it loses hold of what is going on.Take Arcadia 1, not just the masterpiece of this show but one of Riley's greatest works. Green and white and corn and a beautiful variation of cobalt, it is painted directly on the wall. The blue appears to act as a steadying backdrop, but then it leaps forward, taking part in the intersection of curves, verticals and diagonals that create a whole pageant of shapes: leaves, kites, twisting ribbons, the dipping hooves of merry-go-round horses. There is no stopping place, every element is designed, and combined, to send the eye flowing onwards.What you find in this painting may involve music, ballet or ships in full sail. It might have something to do with the seasons, landscape, sunlight or water, as pastoral as the title suggests – common subjects of the National Gallery.But this picture is not figurative. It depicts none of these things. So how does it conjure them all? What Riley offers is an infinite variety of optical experiences, of vitality, freedom, elation. Ultimately the painting appears to float free of the wall itself, nothing pinned down: as open to the eye as the imagination.The dazzle of sunlight on waves is nearly impossible to paint. Everything is in flux. Art has its fixed conventions, of course, from asterisks and zigzags to blank white patches that are supposed to get across the blinding effect of so much brilliance. But it always feels as if the vision is frozen. The play of light on water as a living phenomenon, scintillating, volatile, ever-changing – this is evoked as nowhere else in a painting by Bridget Riley.What you see is a diamond-shaped array of discs on a square white canvas. These discs shift from pale grey to black, in the centre, and then gradually onwards to grey again. As the eye moves across the range, attracted by this supple furling and unfurling, each disc sends up its own bright after-image. Sequins of light rise, scatter and then fade. The permutations are beautiful, and they are endless.Close up, what's more, each disc radiates a coldly glowing halo like a star. Stand further away and the painting seems to swell and shimmer. There are vast and elemental associations here; and there are tiny incidents on the scale of fireworks and spangled waves, and all sustained with little more than tonal variation and geometry. This painting does not depict light – it generates light in itself, and celebrates our perception of it. For all these visions are brought to mind by the movement of our own eyes.Black to White Discs (1962) deserves its place in the National Gallery, and not just because Bridget Riley is rightly regarded as a great classicist. So many contemporary painters invited to exhibit here have displayed weak pastiches or homages to the old masters. Her work stands proud and original.For Riley, the gallery has been \"the book in which we learn to read\", to adapt Cézanne's description of the Louvre. The first work here is her 1949 copy of Jan van Eyck's self-portrait; among the latest is Arcadia I, which appears suffused with the free blue air of Cézanne's Les Grandes Baigneuses, though here the reading has surely ended.Indeed the curious effect of this tremendous show, in which Riley's paintings are displayed alongside permanent works from the collection, is that it makes you see past art anew. Look at her suave ripples and you suddenly realise how Mantegna makes his frieze of figures appear to move continuously in both directions. Look at Riley and you may better appreciate the abstract qualities of Raphael.These old-new pairings soon give way to what is effectively a miniature retrospective – early op-art, 80s stripes, the recent parallel curves and steeply flaring diagonals, cross-cut by verticals. The main gallery is all Riley, and dominated by an immense mural composed of interlinking circles, approximately one metre across, in blazing black on white. Tightly plotted, yet open-ended, it sends the eye round and around in every direction, following the tracery, drawn by particular rhythms, distracted by sparking intersections; a movement as unpredictable as mercury.The means are simple and perspicuous, but the effect is indefinable.

        "text": "The circles fill the wall. I cannot count them. There is not one that does not overlap another. There seems to be a system to the clusterings and overlappings, but I can't grasp that either. It is like a word on the tip of your tongue. I keep getting lost; my eye won't be still. Each circle seems to have a relation to the body that made it – the radius of each circle might be the distance from the elbow to the fingertip – but I am not sure. The white wall is flat and smooth, as if painting began with the wall itself, and the circles on it are almost perfect outlines, perhaps as broad as a woman's finger. I look for where the line – so even, so dispassionate – falters, some human touch. There. But that's not why it doesn't feel mechanical, or a trick. It's more than spinning plates, or a conjuror with his interlocking metal hoops.Getting up close, each open \"O\" feels like an invitation. Something more than pattern is inscribed here. Very often, Bridget Riley's art blows me away. Sometimes she stirs me and makes me want to sit and look for hours, just to be here, in this light with this work. The huge drawing that fills the white wall of the Sunley Room at the National Gallery is the high point of Riley's exhibition. Never mind that we have walked past Mantegna, Raphael and Seurat, these touchstones of Riley's thinking, to get here. Suddenly they are forgotten. Riley's exhibition, which juxtaposes her pictures with work she has picked from the National Gallery collection, is more than a confrontation with her forebears, or even with herself. She brings together works from all periods of her own career. There is 1960s optical art and 1970s stripes, the complex recursive scimitar, flame and sail shapes, and compound curves of the works from the last two decades, with their close-toned saturated colour and compacted compositions. Yet this is less a lesson in history than one of presence, and presentness, of being in the now. The confrontation is really between ourselves and Riley's work.You don't so much look at Bridget Riley's paintings as watch them, as their configurations and forms jostle and shift and change before you. They refuse to settle down and resist easy assimilation. At their best, her works seem alive. Can the same be said of Raphael's St Catherine (1507), with her dirty fingernails, and the wheel on which she was martyred, that imploring big-eyed heavenward look that reminds me of Goya's dog, drowning in quicksand? Can it be said of the mythologies and ancient histories in Mantegna, or of Seurat's working-class loafers beside the Seine on an imaginary Sunday in the late 19th century? Don't they all speak of an elsewhere?Riley is 80 now. When she was making her application to Goldsmiths college in 1949 she made a copy of Jan van Eyck's Portrait of a Man, which is presumed to be a self-portrait. Weirdly, it looks not unlike Riley herself in old age, and stares across at the Raphael and the three Seurat studies for his Bathers at Asnières (1883). Somehow all these works – which are as distant from one another as they are from Riley's own art – seem to form a diagram of some sort, a cat's cradle in which you are trapped between different ideas of presence, and between things that have mattered in different ways to Riley throughout her long working life. It feels such a generous, intimate moment. I hesitate there.Riley would probably see it differently, and ask us to look for concordances of rhythm and colour and enduring formal preoccupations. Putting it bluntly, I cannot think like her. When Riley tried to understand Bonnard's colour, and attempted to analyse Mondrian's Broadway Boogie-Woogie, she encountered her own difficulties, and couldn't follow their logic. Riley's thinking has a kind of clarity I lack, which is why I admire what she does – in her art and her writing – as much as I do. Encounters with difference are important and instructive. But when you look, you have to read the work your own way.Mantegna's frieze-like 1505-6 Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome hangs in a heavy gilded frame on an oxblood wall opposite a wave-like Riley from 1965, which is unframed and hung on a white wall. It's a face-off, not just between very different kinds of art, but between display manners – clarity versus gloom, heaviness versus light, mustiness versus Modern. The attendant guarding this moment told me he'd counted 14 figures in the foreground of the Mantegna, and 14 ribbon-like stripes in the Riley. But we're not looking here for one-to-one relationships, between stripes and figures, or even between the Mantegna, with its linear depictions of drapery and processional composition, and Riley's optical flows and counterflows. You look at the figures in the Mantegna as though you were walking along a carved stone relief. The Riley opposite has its own kind of relief-like illusion of sculpted visual space, but it sings and flows in a way that the Mantegna doesn't, and never could.As much as anything else, it's an encounter with time. Looking at Riley is also an encounter with the activity of your own perceptions: the way a curve will torque and twist, the bright penumbras flickering at the edge between two simultaneously contrasting colours, the way sensory overload forces attention away from one moment in a painting to another, the way colours wince and blink as your eye slides across a surface. It is an existential as much as a phenomenological encounter.Riley knows her art history, and treats the past as though it were present in her art. In her work, she tries to make it new every time. She doesn't always succeed, but that's also why, and how, she's good. Her paintings, uninflected and dispassionate, without trace of a brushstroke, a human twitch or slither, are completed by assistants. Those foolish persons who demand the human touch of the artist are looking in the wrong place. It isn't the object that matters so much as the artist's thought, their sensibility and culture. It isn't the artist's hand that writhes with life. It's the art itself.The stone-sucking systemHow far her art might appear from painting's history. It seems so distinctively modern and of our time. All those Riley paintings appropriated for optical-art dresses and T-shirts, with their stark black-and-whites, and as the covers of LPs (The Faust Tapes from 1973 springs to mind) located her works as an adjunct to fashion. But Riley didn't have to escape fashion. Her work was strong enough to do that by itself. And being used as album artwork never did an artist any harm (think of Gerhard Richter and Sonic Youth), so long as the music was of the right order – not that I really imagine Richter much liking Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation (1988), or Riley getting off on Faust. But you never know with Riley. She has written as brilliantly and perceptively on Bruce Nauman's videos as she has on Cézanne.Artists make their own connections across history, cultures and civilisations, and create their own lineages and narratives, however apparently far-fetched. Riley has said she admires the stone-sucking scene in Samuel Beckett's Molloy, in which Molloy has to invent a system whereby he can suck the stones in his pockets equally. Riley invents her own arcane systems but she surely also admires Beckett's humanity. It is locked in the language and revealed in the imagery, in the jokes as well as the form of Beckett's writing. And so it is with Mantegna or Raphael, as much as in Riley's own art.So many contemporary art shows at the National Gallery have been depressing, let's-get-down-and-dirty with history affairs, self-conscious and embarrassing suck-ups to the old masters. Riley's show is something else.Join the dots: See images from the show, with commentary by the National Gallery's Colin Wiggins, at theguardian.com/artanddesignThe circles fill the wall. I cannot count them. There is not one that does not overlap another. There seems to be a system to the clusterings and overlappings, but I can't grasp that either. It is like a word on the tip of your tongue. I keep getting lost; my eye won't be still. Each circle seems to have a relation to the body that made it – the radius of each circle might be the distance from the elbow to the fingertip – but I am not sure. The white wall is flat and smooth, as if painting began with the wall itself, and the circles on it are almost perfect outlines, perhaps as broad as a woman's finger. I look for where the line – so even, so dispassionate – falters, some human touch. There. But that's not why it doesn't feel mechanical, or a trick. It's more than spinning plates, or a conjuror with his interlocking metal hoops.Getting up close, each open \"O\" feels like an invitation. Something more than pattern is inscribed here. Very often, Bridget Riley's art blows me away. Sometimes she stirs me and makes me want to sit and look for hours, just to be here, in this light with this work. The huge drawing that fills the white wall of the Sunley Room at the National Gallery is the high point of Riley's exhibition. Never mind that we have walked past Mantegna, Raphael and Seurat, these touchstones of Riley's thinking, to get here. Suddenly they are forgotten. Riley's exhibition, which juxtaposes her pictures with work she has picked from the National Gallery collection, is more than a confrontation with her forebears, or even with herself. She brings together works from all periods of her own career. There is 1960s optical art and 1970s stripes, the complex recursive scimitar, flame and sail shapes, and compound curves of the works from the last two decades, with their close-toned saturated colour and compacted compositions. Yet this is less a lesson in history than one of presence, and presentness, of being in the now. The confrontation is really between ourselves and Riley's work.You don't so much look at Bridget Riley's paintings as watch them, as their configurations and forms jostle and shift and change before you. They refuse to settle down and resist easy assimilation. At their best, her works seem alive. Can the same be said of Raphael's St Catherine (1507), with her dirty fingernails, and the wheel on which she was martyred, that imploring big-eyed heavenward look that reminds me of Goya's dog, drowning in quicksand? Can it be said of the mythologies and ancient histories in Mantegna, or of Seurat's working-class loafers beside the Seine on an imaginary Sunday in the late 19th century? Don't they all speak of an elsewhere?Riley is 80 now. When she was making her application to Goldsmiths college in 1949 she made a copy of Jan van Eyck's Portrait of a Man, which is presumed to be a self-portrait. Weirdly, it looks not unlike Riley herself in old age, and stares across at the Raphael and the three Seurat studies for his Bathers at Asnières (1883). Somehow all these works – which are as distant from one another as they are from Riley's own art – seem to form a diagram of some sort, a cat's cradle in which you are trapped between different ideas of presence, and between things that have mattered in different ways to Riley throughout her long working life. It feels such a generous, intimate moment. I hesitate there.Riley would probably see it differently, and ask us to look for concordances of rhythm and colour and enduring formal preoccupations. Putting it bluntly, I cannot think like her. When Riley tried to understand Bonnard's colour, and attempted to analyse Mondrian's Broadway Boogie-Woogie, she encountered her own difficulties, and couldn't follow their logic. Riley's thinking has a kind of clarity I lack, which is why I admire what she does – in her art and her writing – as much as I do. Encounters with difference are important and instructive. But when you look, you have to read the work your own way.Mantegna's frieze-like 1505-6 Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome hangs in a heavy gilded frame on an oxblood wall opposite a wave-like Riley from 1965, which is unframed and hung on a white wall. It's a face-off, not just between very different kinds of art, but between display manners – clarity versus gloom, heaviness versus light, mustiness versus Modern. The attendant guarding this moment told me he'd counted 14 figures in the foreground of the Mantegna, and 14 ribbon-like stripes in the Riley. But we're not looking here for one-to-one relationships, between stripes and figures, or even between the Mantegna, with its linear depictions of drapery and processional composition, and Riley's optical flows and counterflows. You look at the figures in the Mantegna as though you were walking along a carved stone relief. The Riley opposite has its own kind of relief-like illusion of sculpted visual space, but it sings and flows in a way that the Mantegna doesn't, and never could.As much as anything else, it's an encounter with time. Looking at Riley is also an encounter with the activity of your own perceptions: the way a curve will torque and twist, the bright penumbras flickering at the edge between two simultaneously contrasting colours, the way sensory overload forces attention away from one moment in a painting to another, the way colours wince and blink as your eye slides across a surface.

        "description": "First he outraged art audiences in the early '90s with works like his shark in formaldehyde. (The New York city department of health banned one piece on the grounds that it might induce vomiting.) Then he outraged critics with tactics like decorating a cast of a human skull with 8,601 diamonds worth more than $20 million. Now, the ultimate British bad boy has outraged dealers by skipping the gallery and selling his work at auction. He may have just been making a little Hirst-style mischief— or changing the state of the art market forever.",

        "text": "There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL.

Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony.

So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something.

Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows.

The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The Evening Standard Electric ChairThe ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.For the Love of God Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?The GuardianDH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]implied Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.pauseAHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]Meaning the paintings behind me.DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.Hirst laughsDH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.isAHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.hirteen Most Wanted Men AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!laughslaughspauseAHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.The Golden CalfDH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.The Golden Calf.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that."

        "text": "There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?DH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.AHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.DH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.AHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!AHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.DH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that.There is butterfly wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory of the Georgian building that houses Damien Hirst’s London office. On the wall hangs a framed flyposter for the newspaper The Evening Standard that reads: HIRST’S £50M DIAMOND SKULL. Artwork in Hirst’s own office, up a flight of stairs, includes a photograph of Francis Bacon, a green Electric Chair by Andy Warhol, and a sculpture of Christ, likewise in an electric chair, by the fast-rising British artist Paul Fryer. The ensemble suggests two of the artist’s salient characteristics-his bumptiousness and his generosity of spirit-since, aside from Jeff Koons, I am aware of few other artists who display the work of their contemporaries and their juniors. But Hirst showed this godfather-ish streak early on when he put together “Freeze,” the July 1988 exhibition in a warehouse in London’s Docklands that showcased his fellow students at Goldsmiths College and played a significant part in creating the British art world as it is today.The Evening Standard Electric ChairThe ensemble also shows that Hirst is utterly consistent in his obsessions. An early photograph that has become part of his oeuvre shows him grinning wickedly, cheek-to-cheek with the severed head of a fellow who much resembles the 1st-century Roman emperor Galba; it is perhaps the germ of the diamond skull [For the Love of God ]. This piece debuted at a show at Jay Jopling’s White Cube in June 2007. I took in the rest of the exhibition, then climbed the stairs to where the skull glimmered in a black velvet room. Hirst was standing alone at the door. “What a show, man,” I said. “What a showman,” he riposted.For the Love of God Damien Hirst has a tremendous ego, but it doesn’t present itself as a warm bath of self-regard; rather it seems oddly objective, work-oriented, and drenched in irony. Many, though, thought the artist had pushed the boat out a bit too far when he announced that he was putting up two years of work, some 223 pieces, at Sotheby’s, London, cutting out both White Cube and Gagosian Gallery, and indeed paring the auction house’s commission to next to nothing. Flooding the market with the work of a single artist seemed an affront both to ordinary practice and common sense, especially as the event approached, and the financial sky became thunderous. Actually, the sale went through the roof and may well prove to be the high point of this particular art-world cycle. So, what next?ANTHONY HADEN-GUEST: You said even if the auction failed it would open the door.DAMIEN HIRST: Yeah.HADEN-GUEST: What do you see happening? What kind of power do you see artists having, specifically?HIRST: Well, I mean, the art world’s changing, isn’t it? It’s another road where there wasn’t one before. It’s a great advantage to be able to play people off against each other, isn’t it? You go to Christie’s and get a quote on something. And then you go to Phillips’ and you tell them what Christie’s has given you. I like auctions for artists. It wasn’t really like this before, but it is now. Which is great.AHG: So it’s like Madonna and U2 sacking their labels and going independent.DH: Yes. It’s better than doing a fragrance, I guess.AHG: Perhaps you should do a fragrance.DH: Really? Formaldehyde! Crank! Who knows?AHG: The argument against what you’re doing is that artists need dealers because dealers put on shows. Artists, especially young artists, get reviewed and get into the information loop. You have to be at a particular level to do what you have done.DH: I thought it was quite an advantage for young people just starting off to get a bit of interest. The auction houses are interested in being cutting-edge as well as being mainstream. I was thinking of someone like Tim [Noble] or Sue [Webster], for instance, who haven’t really shot off like a rocket but are still at a point where there is a lot of interest in them. They could do a show of 12 works or something, and that could just push them in the right direction. The thing is, it’s risky. But I quite like it to be risky. I’m 43. I’m not ready to sit down in a chair with my name on it yet. I’ve arrived at that point in the art world where there really is a chair that you sit in.AHG: And in the end, writers will have to go where the art is. If it’s on show in an auction house they’ll have to go and review it in an auction house.DH: I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think certain things will suit that and certain things won’t. It will just get more complicated and multilayered and multi-faceted. And it will work better all around. I think about Jeff [Koons]. Maybe he’d put his A.P.s [artist’s proofs] in there? He keeps his A.P.s, doesn’t he? He might want to do a retrospective thing like that. Or it might be good just to put one out to test the market. And then be able to sell through galleries. The great thing is that the options are there. I don’t think I invented anything. It’s like I just saw it, just because I did it first. The road was there. It was going to happen.AHG: Let’s look at your career a bit. You told Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian, “I’ve made maybe four good pieces and the rest are, you know, sort of happy.” I thought that was quite courageousconsidering it was before the auction. Do you believe it?The GuardianDH: It depends where you are looking from. You can be brutal. I used to watch Top of the Pops when I was a kid and say “Yeah!” or “Boo!” at every single song. So there was nothing in the middle. You brutally put it on one side or another. If you want to be brutal, I think there are those four pieces that stand above the rest. But you can draw that line anywhere you want.AHG: When I first saw those pieces they reminded me of some Victorian paintings. They are about life and death. The big issues. Like the insect-o-cutor piece.DH: Yes. That’s a killer piece, isn’t it? God knows where that came from. It’s one of those crazy things that happen early . . . .AHG: You have no idea where that came from?DH: I was pretty down at the time. I was feeling I had to make a piece about something important. Really I was very young to be making something like that. I mean, when I made it, it kind of scared me. I set the whole thing up. I stood back and I felt maybe this is how Oppenheimer might have felt when he split the atom. Because these are living things. I was really worried when the first flies got killed by it. You could feel the pain in it. You think, “Should I be doing this with art? Should I be going in this direction?” It was really quite weird. But it had a kind of beauty about it. I still think that’s the greatest piece that I made.AHG: And that’s the piece Bacon went to see?DH: Yes. That’s the one Bacon spoke about. I haven’t got the letter, but I’ve seen it. The letter was to Louis le Brocquy [the Irish painter]. But I’ve still got the piece! I sold it to Charles Saatchi and then bought it back off him.AHG: You described the auction as drawing a line across your work. No more butterflies. No more spin paintings. What brought this on? You had this incredible machine, a very successful machine. Did it get to be too much?DH: No. I’ve just stopped some things. I’m not slowing down. I just felt I’d gotten to the end of it really. I don’t know. For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight. It’s not the shit going on in the back of the wings-it was never real. So I’ve always been looking for a way to get to the end of it. And then as I got older it has made less and less sense to me. And I just felt this auction was a good way to end things. But like I said . . . I’m doing some very small spots. So it seems to be taking another direction. So I’ll do those. But even with those I think I’ll do something else quite soon as well. I’m doing these . . . [Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed. He is looking at the wall behind me.] paintings. [I turn. Two paintings are hanging. They are tall, narrow. Small vivid dots are urgent, spluttery, bright white, not geo-perfect in any way, against a Prussian blue background. On the right one, there is a small skull facing the viewer frontally. On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.]implied Hirst’s voice lowers. He sounds almost abashed.

On the left the image is of a skull and spine, as if taken from an X-ray. Both are clearly hand-painted.AHG: There was nothing like that in the auction.DH: No. Because it’s not happening yet. I’m working out what to do with it.AHG: The first time we talked on the record, we talked about painting. But since then you’ve said that you stopped making paintings at age 15, when you saw Bacon and turned to sculpture.DH: Yeah.AHG: Did you know that Bacon was going to make sculpture? He got a frame like a Zimmer frame. A Bacon frame. Peter Beard told me he thought that the Marlborough Galleries talked him out of it.DH: Really? Wow! [pause] Probably a good idea.pauseAHG: That he didn’t do it?DH: Yeah. But you never know. I’ve looked at his print sheets, and they’re not too bad. They’re just like paintings, aren’t they?AHG: What are you working on now? Sometimes you talk about interesting tech ideas, like suspending droplets of water in sonic beams. But then you’re talking about going into the shed and getting a grip on painting.DH: Yeah, yeah. I think I’ll do both. I’m actually employing more people. Even though I’ve stopped some of the series.AHG: How many people now?DH: Uh, I dunno . . . 160? Something like that.AHG: In how many work locations?DH: I think I’ve got six studios. Six, yeah. But mainly the one in Gloucestershire. It’s just kind of expanded. We take on more and more people as we go.AHG: But these look like pieces you are making yourself? [Meaning the paintings behind me.]Meaning the paintings behind me.DH: Yes. I make these on my own.AHG: This is really encouraging. [Hirst laughs] You may laugh. But I was wondering where you were going to go, you know.Hirst laughsDH: Yeah. Paint! I also thought I couldn’t imagine the work getting me to the end of my life. If I were going to live for a lot longer, you know. [pause] I was looking at photographs of Jeff Koons. And the smile starts to crack. Do you know what I mean? As you get older . . . And it is about celebration. He made that great series, “Celebration.” In a lot of the work I was celebrating. And you stop celebrating. But the work still is celebrating. It doesn’t make sense.AHG: What do you mean, you stop celebrating?DH: You just get a bit older. I used to walk into a room and get on the table and go, “Hee-hah!” I used to believe I was going to live forever. And then you suddenly become aware that you’re not. You’re celebrating the fact that nothing can stop you. You’re going to fuck everyone! You can’t lose! Like, “Fuck off, this is what I think.” You’re kind of like that and celebrating every moment in that way. And then suddenly . . . I’ve got kids. It’s just gone somehow. You’re not like that anymore. You’ve gone quiet. You’re more cautious. You can walk into the studio one day and just think, This is not me, you know? And especially if you’re doing an endless series. Someone like On Kawara, I mean, I wonder if he ever does that? Like, “Fuck! I’ve just wasted all these years and it’s not me.” He must. It’s artistic doubt.AHG: Or Daniel Buren.DH: Exactly. Anybody who’s done that kind of thing.AHG: There were some great pieces in the auction. But there were some pieces, like the spot painting with a gold background, where I didn’t feel much soul-beating.DH: Yeah! I think that’s why it’s sort of an end to me. I don’t know, you kind of . . . I quite like that logo thing as well. I’ve got a company called Over the Sofa. I’ve always thought at the end of the day art just goes over the fucking sofa. You can’t take it too seriously.AHG: Let’s talk about celebrity. Picasso was a celebrity, but he was very wary of it, and it didn’t get into his art. It ate up Dalí. Then there was Andy. But it seems to me that you’ve taken it a step further. You have actually made it into an art material. You have used fame and money as icon painters used to use gold.DH: Yes. It is an ingredient, I think, in the composition. Especially money. Or power. And all of those things. Even not having it. I mean, it’s important to people who don’t have it. It’s something that’s not to be underestimated or overestimated. A lot of what I did is “What if?” I wonder what would happen if we do this and not that? There are no limits really, are there? But you can get yourself into some awkward situations where maybe you didn’t want to be. I had no money when I was young, so I think that forced me . . . and also Frank [Dunphy], my business manager. He’s totally on my side. He only works with me.AHG: He worked with Tim [Noble] and Sue [Webster], didn’t he?DH: He’s worked with them. But nobody sort of took it that one step further. Nobody took him on. Because you have to give away a bit in order to get there. Remember, I was on 50-50 with Jay [Jopling]. And then, when Frank came along, I had to go to 40 percent because I had to give Frank 10 percent. So it was 50 to Jay, 40 to me, 10 to Frank. So that was awkward. But I had the foresight to do that . . . Now, fundamentally, it’s problematic going under 50.AHG: I was going through the auction catalogues and cuttings and stuff in a magazine office. Somebody asked why, and I said I was off to interview you. One girl squealed and said, “Can I come and hold your tape recorder?” And these are sophisticated people. Jackson Pollock didn’t get that kind of response. Probably not even Picasso got that kind of response. It’s partly because of our celebrity-mad times, but I think it’s also partly because of the changes that you and a few others have made in the art world.DH: I quite like what happens when you make the kind of money that we made in the auction. Because money does talk. There are a lot of people who like money but who don’t like art. And when you see that . . . I love that.AHG: Objectively, it’s not that much money. People seem to think it’s remarkable that an artist should make as much money as a footballer, or an actor who is at roughly the same career level.DH: Somebody offered me a Picasso painting the other day for $140 million. You just go, “Thank God for that! Thank God the value’s there at that level.” It means there’s a long way to go.AHG: Where are you going to hang it?DH: No. I didn’t buy it.AHG: That was a joke.DH: Yeah. I didn’t buy it. But I would!AHG: I hear you have a Bacon in your play room. Is it the self-portrait?DH: In my TV room? No. It’s the scene at the base of the Crucifixion. 1944.AHG: So now you’re getting back to painting. It’s as if Duchamp didn’t just give up art but wanted to become Picasso.DH: It kind of makes sense to do it. I think painting like this has more to do with the fly pieces than any of the newer sculptures. If my success as a sculptor is in those four pieces, in that whole career, then I think you can minimize it into painting and have a different kind of success.AHG: You said, “I want people to say ‘Wow!’ I don’t want people to see how my mind works.” But I think if people look at your early pieces, they are going to get a sense of how your mind works. And if people look at these paintings they are going to get a sense of how your mind works.DH: Yeah. I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints. Unemotional paintings anyway. I think I’ve gone through that time and time again-paintings that continue emotions but aren’t emotional. Like a spot painting is that kind of grid. But it does awaken something, it works in some way. But they are denying something; they are all denying something. And in the end I’ve just gotten to the point where I can’t deny it anymore.AHG: Other artists have attacked you for using their ideas. John LeKay said the skulls were his idea. John Armleder never actually said it, he’s too sophisticated, but that the spots were his idea-that he was doing spot paintings. And some say Walter Robinson did the spin paintings first.DH: Fuck ’em all! Who knows? Before I went to Goldsmiths, I sort of tried to be original. But then there’s just so much in the world, and so much of it is derivative. Everything comes from somewhere and it’s just such a mish-mash. At Goldsmiths we were kind of freed. You don’t have to worry about that! If it looks good, it is good. I remember the fly piece and I remember thinking about the direct references of that. Like Dan Graham for the steel-and-glass, the bus shelter-type things. And Bruce Nauman was in the neons. You know, the fly killer. And then Bacon obviously in the meat. Even Naum Gabo with the flies in space. It’s an amalgam, a mish-mash of everything you’ve ever seen before. Like my medicine cabinets were from Koons. If you are constantly creating visual things, you are getting loads of ideas from everywhere. I think that there’s only been one idea and that was fucking painting your hand red in blood and stamping it on the cave wall. And then, after that, we’ve all just ripped that off and copied it. But what I think is probably different about our generation is that we never felt the need to be original. That kind of frees you up to do what you want. I mean, like the spot paintings. There was Larry Poons.isAHG: Bridget Riley?DH: Yeah, Bridget Riley. But Richter as well. Richter’s squares.AHG: Sigmar Polke? Roy Lichtenstein?DH: Polke, Lichtenstein, yeah. So they are all in there. If it’s a good idea, then lots of people have had it before.AHG: It seems to me that one thing that distinguishes good artists from the rest is that most good artists are willing to fail. Ben Nicholson was the typical British artist-wonderful, good taste. I think you guys-not just you, but your generation-changed all that.DH: I think that had to do with Saatchi. He was just there at the perfect point with a huge fucking space. At Cork Street . . . You just couldn’t fit the size of paintings we wanted to make into Cork Street. It’s just that as a student you go and look at all those galleries. And that was the art world, that fucking British art world. There was the Lisson Gallery, which was very snobby. And Nicholas [Logsdail, the director] was virtually saying go back to your studio for five years and have a little think. And even that was a little shop in the beginning. If you were supposed to fit in in the art world you would have had to scale the work down. And then Saatchi did that New York show. I remember walking in and going, “Hey, my eyes!” The whiteness of it! It just blew me away. And it was so not British. And that just totally inspired all of the students. We wanted to show at the Saatchi Gallery immediately. And then we started making work really to fit there. And that’s when I realized we wouldn’t fit into the art world the way it was. So I just went and got a warehouse, and we did that show. That wasn’t very British. You know, Warhol had done Thirteen Most Wanted Men huge. But Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton were still doing these small paintings. And little things. Very kind of local and small.hirteen Most Wanted Men AHG: You didn’t just conceive the “Freeze” show, you were there making tea and bacon sandwiches.DH: Yeah. We were all doing it, really.AHG: I heard you were doing that at Sotheby’s, too.DH: A bit, yeah. I look at people who have big businesses, and they are fucking mean. They run them like tyrants, treating people like shit, so everybody is on their toes, trying to please. And they are very successful businesses. But I’ve never done it that way. I always try to make everyone mellow down-make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. In a way you are hiring artists, you know? A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.AHG: Have any of them done okay as artists?DH: Rachel Howard. She painted spots. She’s got a great painting downstairs.AHG: The timing of your sale was quite dramatic. I mean, you couldn’t have planned to have banks collapsing around you . . .DH: I know! [laughs] It’s bonkers. I mean, I woke up in the morning and it said in the newspaper “Black Monday.” And I was like, “Fuck! Shit!” It’s very bad timing. I just thought, This is terrible, you know. And then to sell that amount of stuff when banks are collapsing is just unfuckingbelievable. So, of course, in a situation like that the rumors go flying. Don’t they? And the stories just don’t make sense. [laughs] There’s no cash incentive to rig it. I mean, unless you’re insane. You’d have to be. Why would I do it? I’d have to do it with a view to some long-term goal or invest a $100 million in a long-term gain further down the line. It’s just bonkers, isn’t it? How can you fucking do that? And no one would do that with you. And to get the galleries to do that with you? Everyone’s too mean. [pause] It would be a brilliant scam!laughslaughspauseAHG: So the auction worked? It broadened the whole game?DH: Yeah. A lot of people bought who never bought before. I love that. I’ve got collectors who have never been to either of my galleries. Which is fantastic!AHG: You know some of them?DH: Oh, yeah! I made sure that I knew them all.AHG: You get close to your collectors, don’t you?DH: Some of them. If they are interested in investing in that kind of stuff. And they are going to build the museums of the future, which is great.AHG: I met one of your collectors on my way to Basel. She said you called her offering to exchange her fly piece for a better one.DH: Oh, yeah. She’s great. It’s especially now that I’m not drinking. Because when I used to drink … I remember when I was with [artist] Sarah Lucas, a collector called up and said, “The piece that I bought from you is decaying. There’s something wrong with it.” And Sarah just said, “You can give it back to me, but you’re not getting any fucking money!” I love that! I used to do the same thing when I was really drinking a lot. But then you stop drinking, and you’re not living in the moment as much. It’s like a group show, isn’t it? You suddenly look back, and somebody’s got, like, 10 pieces. And you look at them, and you can see that they should have one of these, and they’ve got too many of those, and if you just switch it around it becomes a better collection. And you can engage with them more. A great collector friend of mine was Jay Chiat, who died. When you get more mortal you really work more with collectors.AHG: You have really got death on your mind?DH: You know, I always have. It’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened. I definitely think about it. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it. Maybe I shouldn’t? I don’t know. We’re here for a good time-not a long time. I love quotes like that. There are no pockets in a shroud.AHG: How many hours a day do you work?DH: All the time, really. I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.AHG: The main piece in the auction was The Golden Calf. And you had a drawing that went with it saying “Beware False Idols!” I wondered, were you trying to pull the temple down? And then I thought, No.The Golden CalfDH: It works on many levels. I was working on cow things, and mad cow disease came out, and it became very topical and very of the moment. It’s kind of a happy accident. But it makes it all the more important. So I had an idea to do The Golden Calf. I knew we needed a big piece to kind of pull the whole exhibition together. And then when you think about all the references to the art market, and the stock market, and cash, and belief, and everything, and religion kind of falling apart . . . All of those things made me realize that was definitely the right thing to do. But I never go for a complete obvious meaning and say, “Right, that’s the way I want it to look.” It’s always just lots and lots of universal triggers. And when it’s a combination of all the ideas, it feels right. So I go ahead with it. And the gold! I mean, rather than avoiding it, go with it! Especially since I was aware that I’ve got to come up with something to match the diamond skull.The Golden Calf.AHG: What will happen to the diamond skull?DH: Well, we’ve got an agreement that it will maybe be auctioned. I had hoped that it would get sold privately to someone in the next eight years. It depends what happens with this debt and stuff. But I think it’s starting to look cheap. Isn’t it?AHG: $80 million is cheap?DH: I was offered a Picasso for a $140 million, remember? So there’s definitely room. It depends, you know. What happens when Jeff’s bunny comes up in auction. What is that going to go for? [The owner] turned down $60 million.AHG: I saw Jeff at a party. He looked stressed. I asked how he was coping. He said you just have to keep your focus.DH: It’s quite a frightening position to be in, isn’t it? For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.AHG: I’d say four out of five kids in degree shows draw and paint better than the pros. But not many are going to become artists. What are the characteristics an artist needs for success?DH: First of all you’ve got to be oblivious to other people-the push and pull of other people’s opinions, the way other people measure success. It’s then that you realize you are 100 percent who you are and you have to use that who-you-are 100 percent in order to create great things. And that’s very difficult because everyone wants to be better than they are. You’ve really got to get down on the floor with yourself and get low in order to make great art. I think you’ve just got to accept who you are and do the most unbelievable things. If you’re in a gallery looking at Velázquez paintings and thinking, I want to paint like that, and you’re not able to . . . you’ve got to accept your limitations in order to exceed them. You’ve got to accept that you’re a child-you’ve got to think, Look, I know this is impossible, but I’m going to fucking well go through with it anyway. When I was doing the paintings like Bacon and I gave up, it was really like an ego thing or something. When I started painting again two years ago, I secretly thought that everything I have learned on the other side of the art world has put me in a better position to paint. But it didn’t. The worst thing for me when I started painting two years ago again was that it was exactly like I was when I was 15 or 16, and I stopped.AHG: You had a show of paintings in New York that was pretty much blasted.DH: Yeah. The paintings . . . I have to admit they weren’t that great. But I felt it was the moment to say, “This is what I’m doing now,” not to wait two or three years. When I was asked what kind of reviews do I hate the most, I said it’s really reviews like those, where they kind of slag it off. Now the paintings are just infinitely better. Yeah, I think that’s the worst review of all-when you read it and you agree with it.AHG: What has been the difference since you began painting again two years ago?DH: The only thing that was different when I began painting again was that I had the belief that if I just went for it, I would get through that Bacon thing, and it would be worth it. And I just believed that by persevering I could get through it. I never believed that before. The only way to get rid of it is to go through it. I’ve got, like, triptychs. And then hopefully I might have a period for a few years which is very much like Bacon and then go off on my own. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Youcan’t bypass it if that’s your natural way.AHG: When will you show this work?DH: I haven’t worked out what I am going to do with it yet. I was thinking of doing a show with the Wallace Collection here. [Lucian] Freud showed there in 2004. And I thought maybe something small. But I’m not in a rush. I don’t feel like I did with the other work, like it’s going to go anywhere. I don’t feel in any rush-I just want to get it running. I’m going to get a load of shit for doing it. And I need to be 100 percent behind the work before I show it. The great thing about painting now is that I’ve gotten to the point where I can forget everything just by doing it. And I never used to be able to do that."

Riley found the term offensive, says art historian Richard Shiff, an expert on her work. \"She was always an original, never just a member of any group, and if people called her an op artist it left her open for people to say 'oh nobody's doing op art any more' so they would have had no reason to look at Bridget Riley any more. But there is always a reason to look at Bridget Riley, and understand the excellence of her work.\"All the works in the exhibition are stripe paintings, ranging from the modestly scaled black and white of Horizontal Vibrations made in 1961, to the glowing colours of six huge new canvases completed this year.Shiff relishes the slight irregularities he detects in the earliest paintings before she began getting studio assistants to execute her work. \"But to her using the assistants was an improvement - she didn't want to see any imperfection from the hand of the artist.\"Although the paintings initially seem so strict and severe, Schiff sees not just the colours she has actually placed on the canvases, but what he calls \"phantom colours\" achieved by the contrast between the stripes. In one she changed a single stripe, after the canvas was finished and had been photographed, to achieve exactly the effect she wanted.He also sees some surprising influences of painters she admires.\"You might not walk in off the street and immediately think she has been looking at the work of Renoir,\" he said. \"But it's all there in the colour. Look at one inch of a Cezanne, and you'll find these colours in it.\"Zwirner hopes the exhibition will mark a lasting relationship between his gallery and Riley, even if that means losing his office again.\"We will do whatever she asks us to do,\" he said. \"She deserves no less.\"• Bridget Riley, the Stripe Paintings 1961 - 2014, David Zwirner Gallery London, free, until 25 JulyMore than a decade after her last major exhibition in London, Dame Bridget Riley agreed to a show which covers a half century of her career but includes new paintings, because she loved the gallery building. Then she virtually dismantled it.Bridget RileyRenowned for her perfectionism, the 83-year-old artist went through three floors of David Zwirner's tall elegant Georgian building in Mayfair with the enthusiasm of a television home improvements team tackling a suburban semi. New walls were built, windows blocked up, the entire lighting scheme replaced.David Zwirner's tall elegant Georgian building in Mayfair\"She is completely amazing, she did everything.

The mix of media shifts between sculptures, texts, drawings and woven rugs. Such fragmented elements are combined to produce cryptic assemblages that are neither abstract nor figurative, but unrelentingly peculiar. Cultural references range from the humoral theories of ancient Greek medicine, through medieval illuminated manuscript design, to cosmological history. The exhibition title, The Weakened Eye Of Day, is taken from a 1899 Thomas Hardy poem mourning the passing of the light until birdsong awakens the poet from melancholy.Irish Museum Of Modern Art, to 21 SepRCThe Wind Tunnel Project, Farnborough Wind Tunnel Project. Photograph: Chris O'Donovan Farnborough’s wind tunnels have been testing aircraft since 1917. Racing cars were also observed in them during the 1990s, but in recent years, these listed buildings have stood empty. To mark their public opening this month, two artists are bringing their history to life. Thor McIntyre-Burnie is making the most of the tunnels’ cathedral-like acoustics, with a sound work partly inspired by the BBC’s accidental recording of a second world war bombing raid. Echoing around the lofty space, it nicely plays up aircraft’s double-edged association of freedom and threat. James Bridle, meanwhile, has a personal connection to the tunnels: his grandfather used to work here. His “rainbow plane” installation explores the invisible presence of surveillance technology. The Wind Tunnel Project, Mon 9 Jun to 20 JulSSNasreen Mohamedi, Liverpool Untitled by Nasreen. Photograph: Anil Rane Timed to coincide with the Tate Liverpool’s Mondrian exhibition, this largest ever UK show of drawings and photographs by the late Indian artist Nasreen Mohamedi could very well steal the limelight. Seemingly more sensitive and introverted than any of her western modernist contemporaries, Mohamedi dedicated herself to a lifetime’s pursuit of what she called “the maximum of the minimum” and “the limitless of limits”. In painstakingly composed pen and pencil drawings she conjures geometric abstractions that evoke fleeting states of mind. Monochrome photographs of waves breaking on a beach or of unremarkable street corners offer glimpses into places to pause and reflect. This might all seem esoteric, but to see over 60 Mohamedi works hung together creates a seductive charm. Tate Liverpool, to 5 OctRCBritish Folk Art, LondonThe Tate is raising a Toby Jug to people who never dreamed their output would find its way to a gallery wall, or indeed might not have known or cared what a gallery was. Regional collections countrywide have been scoured to assemble 400 years of work by Britain’s often anonymous craftspeople. From ships’ figureheads to shop signs and pincushions, the offerings are by turns exquisitely crafted and rivetingly odd. There’s James Williams’s patchwork bedspread depicting a naked Adam amid jungle animals, for instance; and George Smart, the Georgian tailor who made pictures of rural characters from fabric scraps, which became a tourist attractions in his native Sussex.Tate Britain, SW1, Tue 10 Jun to 31 AugSSMark Garry, DublinBriefly celebrated as the New York folk world’s answer to Billie Holiday before dying in obscurity from drink and drugs, Karen Dalton is represented here as Mark Garry’s tragic everywoman, in three large-scale silkscreen prints. Elsewhere, Garry crafts a film where a white feather drifts through a darkened room before being caught and held for the briefest of moments, then let go. In an accompanying series of photographs, the darkness seems unrelenting until suddenly punctuated by the shock of a magnolia blossom. Garry constantly points us to things on their way out or altogether gone.Kerlin Gallery, to 28 JunRCBridget Riley: The Stripe Paintings, LondonWhat Bridget Riley can do with a straight line is marvellous. In this stripes-focused survey, she confounds and seduces the eye, varying density, colour and rhythm, across paintings culled from the past five decades. The earliest offering, with lateral stripes in the black-and-white palette that made Riley a reluctant pop sensation, dates from 1961. Rightly titled Horizontal Vibration, it seems to pulse, like plucked violin strings. At the end of that decade her experiments with optics and the essential ingredients of painting, including the visual beats, space and colour she so admired in Old Masters like Raphael, expand to works with colour like the diagonal lilac, white, red and green stripes of the diptych Prairie. The looser colour schemes of her 1980s works were inspired by the palette of ancient Egyptian art, while, with their undulating horizons, her most recent lushly hued offerings recall landscapes.David Zwirner, W1, Fri 13 Jun to 25 JulSSCornelia Parker; The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, London Cornelia Parker's room. Photograph: Benedict Johnson The Royal Academy’s Summer Show might lean on the traditional side with plenty of nudes, still lifes and landscapes, but alongside work by established artists, unknowns are given space.

Dazed & Confused’s visual arts editor Francesca Gavin curates a show which asks what remains in contemporary art of the transcendental spirit of the rave scene. On the face of it, the clinical, typical white cube gallery with its calculating dealers and theorising academics might seem diametrically removed from the improvised DIY tactics and utopian hedonism of rave. But Gavin recognises aspects of rave in the high-tech media of today’s brightest gallery work. So here the likes of Hannah Perry, Christian J Peterson and Harry Burdon, together with Jeremy Deller, present digitally infused reflections on neo-psych that are as seductively in your face as they are brazenly off their bonce.

There’s James Williams’s patchwork bedspread depicting a naked Adam amid jungle animals, for instance; and George Smart, the Georgian tailor who made pictures of rural characters from fabric scraps, which became a tourist attractions in his native Sussex.Tate Britain, SW1, Tue 10 Jun to 31 AugTate Britain, SW1, Tue 10 Jun to 31 AugTate Britain, SW1, Tue 10 Jun to 31 AugTate BritainSSSSMark Garry, DublinBriefly celebrated as the New York folk world’s answer to Billie Holiday before dying in obscurity from drink and drugs, Karen Dalton is represented here as Mark Garry’s tragic everywoman, in three large-scale silkscreen prints. Elsewhere, Garry crafts a film where a white feather drifts through a darkened room before being caught and held for the briefest of moments, then let go. In an accompanying series of photographs, the darkness seems unrelenting until suddenly punctuated by the shock of a magnolia blossom. Garry constantly points us to things on their way out or altogether gone.Kerlin Gallery, to 28 JunKerlin Gallery, to 28 JunKerlin Gallery, to 28 JunKerlin GalleryRCRCBridget Riley: The Stripe Paintings, LondonWhat Bridget Riley can do with a straight line is marvellous. In this stripes-focused survey, she confounds and seduces the eye, varying density, colour and rhythm, across paintings culled from the past five decades. The earliest offering, with lateral stripes in the black-and-white palette that made Riley a reluctant pop sensation, dates from 1961. Rightly titled Horizontal Vibration, it seems to pulse, like plucked violin strings. At the end of that decade her experiments with optics and the essential ingredients of painting, including the visual beats, space and colour she so admired in Old Masters like Raphael, expand to works with colour like the diagonal lilac, white, red and green stripes of the diptych Prairie. The looser colour schemes of her 1980s works were inspired by the palette of ancient Egyptian art, while, with their undulating horizons, her most recent lushly hued offerings recall landscapes.Bridget RileyDavid Zwirner, W1, Fri 13 Jun to 25 JulDavid Zwirner, W1, Fri 13 Jun to 25 JulDavid Zwirner, W1, Fri 13 Jun to 25 JulDavid ZwirnerSSSSCornelia Parker; The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, London Cornelia Parker's room. Photograph: Benedict Johnson Cornelia Parker's room. Photograph: Benedict Johnson The Royal Academy’s Summer Show might lean on the traditional side with plenty of nudes, still lifes and landscapes, but alongside work by established artists, unknowns are given space. Artist Cornelia Parker meanwhile, is curating a room of black and white-only work by some of her favourite artists. David Shrigley, Bob and Roberta Smith and Turner winner Laure Provost all take part, while Martin Creed’s contribution is a neon that simply reads “Assholes”.

Dazed & Confused’s visual arts editor Francesca Gavin curates a show which asks what remains in contemporary art of the transcendental spirit of the rave scene. On the face of it, the clinical, typical white cube gallery with its calculating dealers and theorising academics might seem diametrically removed from the improvised DIY tactics and utopian hedonism of rave. But Gavin recognises aspects of rave in the high-tech media of today’s brightest gallery work. So here the likes of Hannah Perry, Christian J Peterson and Harry Burdon, together with Jeremy Deller, present digitally infused reflections on neo-psych that are as seductively in your face as they are brazenly off their bonce.

        "text": "Bridget Riley's restless, rigorous works have fascinated art lovers since, in the 1960s, she first created her abstract, op-art-inflected paintings that beguile the eye with their sense of flickering movement and space.Now audiences around the country will be able to see, for the first time in the UK, four major recent works lent by Riley herself, alongside seminal paintings from the 1960s and a number of works on paper. Among the last group are three \"colour study\" pieces from 1967, which have never before left Riley's studio and which she has now donated to the Arts Council collection.Among the earlier works is her Movement in Squares, bought by the Arts Council collection in 1962, a year after it was made. \"It was her breakthrough work,\" said Caroline Douglas, director of the collection. \"It set her on the direction she was to take for the next 40 years.\"The exhibition will be accompanied by a new essay by Riley, in which she describes the process that brought her to this mode of abstract painting.\"One evening on my way to the studio,\" she writes, \"I thought of drawing a square. Everyone knows what a square looks like and how to make one in geometric terms … I drew the first few squares. No discoveries there. Was there anything to be found in a square?\"But as I drew, things began to change. Quite suddenly something was happening down there on the paper that I had not anticipated. I continued, I went on drawing; I pushed ahead, both intuitively and consciously.\"The squares began to lose their original form. They were taking on a new pictorial identity. I drew the whole of Movement in Squares without a pause and then, to see more clearly what was there, I painted each alternate space black. When I stepped back, I was surprised and elated by what I saw.\"The recent works that Riley is to lend to the exhibition include Painting With Verticals I (2006). The extent to which her artistic concerns have both developed and stayed consistent are evident: there is a more complex play of verticals, diagonals and curves; and she has moved away from monochrome to use a warm palette of pinks and browns.According to Douglas, the 78-year-old Riley is \"one of the most important painters working today. Her career is of such a distinguished length and consistency, and she provides a bridge almost to a pre-modern moment in a way, since her concerns in painting are anchored in Cézanne and Seurat.\"She has spent a career pushing the medium, and herself; she has never wavered in her sense of purpose.\"The exhibition is the first in a series under the collective title Flashback, which, organised by the Hayward Gallery in London and drawn largely from the Arts Council collection (which it administrates), will tour museums in England.Each exhibition will unite major recent works by an artist with important early pieces, often bought by Arts Council England at key moments in an artist's young career. The next show in the series will focus on the sculptor Anish Kapoor.Part of the purpose of the series of touring exhibitions, said Douglas, is to \"celebrate our regional collections, especially when the question of local authorities selling works of art hangs in the air.\"These collections, which you can see for free, are of immeasurable value. For the person who sees a Mondrian in their lunch hour in Norwich, and then goes on to be an artist, that effect cannot be measured.\"Exhibition opens at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool (25 September - 13 December 2009) and tours to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (6 February - 23 May 2010), Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery (5 June - 5 September) and Southampton City Art Gallery (17 September - 5 December).Bridget Riley's restless, rigorous works have fascinated art lovers since, in the 1960s, she first created her abstract, op-art-inflected paintings that beguile the eye with their sense of flickering movement and space.Now audiences around the country will be able to see, for the first time in the UK, four major recent works lent by Riley herself, alongside seminal paintings from the 1960s and a number of works on paper.

        "text": "The head of a leading arts organisation has warned that London’s status as a world-class creative city is at risk because artists are being forced out of the capital.Anna Harding, the chief executive of Space studios, which provides premises for nearly 800 artists including three Turner prize winners, blamed rising property prices and shrinking studios for dramatically squeezing the time and space available for creative activity. Artists now face a choice between working full time to pay the rent and fitting in a few hours in their studios at weekends, or giving up entirely, she said.Harding’s stark warning comes in a book, Artists in the City: SPACE in ’68 and Beyond, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the organisation set up by Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley, leading proponents of Op art, who were frustrated that London’s artists had to work in cramped garden studios. The pair renovated a warehouse in St Katharine Docks which allowed them and others to create art on a much larger scale. Space now operates 17 studios in London and Colchester, a model used by similar organisations like Acme and Bow Arts. Tenants include the Turner prize winners Laure Prouvost, Mark Leckey and Tomma Abts, as well as Heather Phillipson whose work will occupy the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2020.In her introduction to the book, Harding writes: “Lack of affordable living and working space for low-waged people in London is forcing many to reconsider their future in the capital. Increasing rents underpin the story of artists living and working in London, and the challenges of affording a studio and making work have worsened considerably.“Practices, studio sizes and lifestyles have had to adjust to the challenge of living in a congested and increasingly expensive, yet stimulating, city. Vital resources, such as studio space and alternative arts venues, should not be taken for granted. Without them, London’s preeminence as a creative city is at risk.” Space co-founder Bridget Riley in her studio at St Katharine Docks in about 1970. Arts and culture contribute about £11.8bn to the UK economy, according to the Arts Council, but the majority of artists earn less than £10,000 a year. An EU-funded Space initiative called London Creative Network, which has been mentoring and helping more than 400 artists to use technology, found that 83% of them earned less than the London living wage of £10.20 per hour. Many have gone to seaside towns like Margate and Whitstable, while others have simply left the UKfor cities like Berlin.Speaking to the Observer, Harding said: “People forget that you need a whole ecosystem to create [London’s preeminence as a creative city]. You need 800 people to create eight famous names. There’s a perception that artists are rich because of a few people. But underneath, there is all this research and development going on. “ In the early days of Space, artists might have needed a teaching job for two days a week. Now it’s five days and you hope you can get in at the weekend. Their creativity is being wasted and that’s really bad for the economy as well.”She said Space has been working with developers and landlords to find studio space in new developments, but “it’s much more difficult to find spaces – we are competing with residential properties, too. Yard spaces are disappearing, so you can’t find the large spaces, you can’t get a car or van in to deliver things, or you can’t make noise because there’s residential property next door.”The book, published this weekend, includes contributions from Riley and Sedgley, as well as some of the 3,000 artists who have used Space studios since it was founded. Riley’s essay recalls how she and Sedgley searched for disused buildings. “One of the most memorable of these was Marshalsea prison, a debtors’ prison on the edge of the Thames,” she writes. “The building was too far gone to rescue, and so Peter’s search continued further along the Thames. Near Tower Bridge, he saw the gates to St Katharine Docks.”They found the ivory warehouse and with the help of the Lord Admiral – Admiralty House was at the other end of the docks – persuaded the council to grant them a lease. “Once we had the keys, a small party set to work cleaning out the warehouse.

Artists now face a choice between working full time to pay the rent and fitting in a few hours in their studios at weekends, or giving up entirely, she said.Harding’s stark warning comes in a book, Artists in the City: SPACE in ’68 and Beyond, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the organisation set up by Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley, leading proponents of Op art, who were frustrated that London’s artists had to work in cramped garden studios. The pair renovated a warehouse in St Katharine Docks which allowed them and others to create art on a much larger scale. Space now operates 17 studios in London and Colchester, a model used by similar organisations like Acme and Bow Arts. Tenants include the Turner prize winners Laure Prouvost, Mark Leckey and Tomma Abts, as well as Heather Phillipson whose work will occupy the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2020.In her introduction to the book, Harding writes: “Lack of affordable living and working space for low-waged people in London is forcing many to reconsider their future in the capital. Increasing rents underpin the story of artists living and working in London, and the challenges of affording a studio and making work have worsened considerably.“Practices, studio sizes and lifestyles have had to adjust to the challenge of living in a congested and increasingly expensive, yet stimulating, city. Vital resources, such as studio space and alternative arts venues, should not be taken for granted. Without them, London’s preeminence as a creative city is at risk.” Space co-founder Bridget Riley in her studio at St Katharine Docks in about 1970. Arts and culture contribute about £11.8bn to the UK economy, according to the Arts Council, but the majority of artists earn less than £10,000 a year. An EU-funded Space initiative called London Creative Network, which has been mentoring and helping more than 400 artists to use technology, found that 83% of them earned less than the London living wage of £10.20 per hour. Many have gone to seaside towns like Margate and Whitstable, while others have simply left the UKfor cities like Berlin.Speaking to the Observer, Harding said: “People forget that you need a whole ecosystem to create [London’s preeminence as a creative city]. You need 800 people to create eight famous names. There’s a perception that artists are rich because of a few people. But underneath, there is all this research and development going on. “ In the early days of Space, artists might have needed a teaching job for two days a week. Now it’s five days and you hope you can get in at the weekend. Their creativity is being wasted and that’s really bad for the economy as well.”She said Space has been working with developers and landlords to find studio space in new developments, but “it’s much more difficult to find spaces – we are competing with residential properties, too. Yard spaces are disappearing, so you can’t find the large spaces, you can’t get a car or van in to deliver things, or you can’t make noise because there’s residential property next door.”The book, published this weekend, includes contributions from Riley and Sedgley, as well as some of the 3,000 artists who have used Space studios since it was founded. Riley’s essay recalls how she and Sedgley searched for disused buildings. “One of the most memorable of these was Marshalsea prison, a debtors’ prison on the edge of the Thames,” she writes. “The building was too far gone to rescue, and so Peter’s search continued further along the Thames.

Last summer I wrote catalogue pieces on Ken Price and John Chamberlain. They were both my friends and my essays turned out to be inadvertent obituaries. I take this as a sign. Also, most writing about art these days is so bad that my secular readership has disappeared. Nobody but professionals and grad students even look at it. So no more e-mails from civilians, no more notes from John Updike or Steve Martin, no more crazy hipsters from Berkeley knocking on my door. Also, the art world has turned nasty for some reason and my gentility has come out of the closet. I cry when people scream at me, unless we’re just haggling about prices.Sarah Douglas: But you’ll still be writing?I will be writing, however, revising material for three anthologies and writing another book. The first is a book of essays about the work of women artists because no such book exists. I have about 20 essays about art from Bridget Riley’s to Elizabeth Peyton’s. I wanted to do something for my late friend [New Museum founder] Marcia Tucker, who actually introduced me firsthand to the art world. We agreed on nothing at all so I thought I’d dedicate a book to her about art she would have hated. That would be very Marcia and Dave. I’m also revising a second volume of Air Guitarcalled Connoisseur of Waves, which is a little more focused on architecture, jazz, movies and surfing. I am writing a book called Pagan Americathat has grown out of an essay of mine called “American Beauty.” I also have a completed book of shorter essays called Pirates and Farmersthat is light, funny and very mean spirited.Sarah Douglas: Hmmm…a sort of partial retirement then?In other words, I plan to disappear like Marcel Duchamp, which is to not quite disappear. I’m about to leave…oops, I haven’t left yet but keep on looking. I’m about to leave. I’m giving it all up for chess, that type of thing. I’m actually giving it all up for statistics. My mother was an economics professor. I’m proficient in math, and statistics, game theory, symbolic logic and all of that. I want to write a creative writing book about the statistics of literary prose accompanied by software so you could compare the statistical shape of your writing to that of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Dickens, Ray Carver or David Foster Wallace. My idea is to provide professors a way of teaching creative writing without having to read quires of crap. Also, I really believe that most of the problems with literary prose tend to be statistical. They have to do with sequencing, and the calculus is helpful in gaining this sort of information. When I was in graduate school I invented a grammar based on the paragraph rather than the sentence—very radical at the time. I also had works by writers in three states of revision so I could say: the numbers are like this here, and then here and then here. So I could make empirically based observations about intention. Hemingway means to do this. Gertrude Stein means to do this. D.H. Lawrence means to do this. I was fighting against professorial Freudian and Marxist musings on the artist’s intentions. I hate all that woozy political and psychotherapeutic crap applied to books and art.I hope Dave gets cracking on this because I for one could use a new alternative to the existential gnashing of turning out Fine Prose that ain't got too much wrong with it. Also, there are a few sections from Gilbert Sorrentino's Misterioso I'd like to put through Hickey's software program for my own edification. (Though it's really Pagan America I'm setting a lantern in my window for.)What about art critics? Do they have any place in this system anymore? They used to have an influence over whether people bought things or not. Do they still have that?We have no power at all. We just market aphorisms. This is mostly because of magazine economics. Good critics are expensive. I am expensive. Academics work for free to get tenure, and, since they are worried about the approval of their colleagues, they are fearful of making value judgments. Also, most of my peers and contemporaries learned how to write magazine journalism. We know how to do a transition, we know how to do a lead, we know what a hook is, and we’re literate. Most critics today come out of art academia, where they don’t even understand the future-imperfect tense. People like me, the late Bob Hughes [see Jim Kelly's perceptive eulogy on Robert Hughes at VF Daily], Chris Knight, Peter Plagens, Jerry Saltz and Peter Schjeldahl—we’re sort of like sewing machine repairmen after the sewing machine has gone out of fashion.Wonder if Dave has read Tom Wolfe's Art Basel Miami Beach section in Back to Blood, what he thinks of it. I have Dave's email so I guess I could just ask him but, you know me, I hate to bother people.*A beautifully rendered postcard illustrating this image can be purchased directly from me c/o Vanity Fair Craftworks.Art critic, Vanity Fair contributor, and all-around super-seer Dave Hickey announced in an interview given to Sarah Douglas at GalleristNY that he is paddling into semi-retirement, silhouetted against the sinking sun as it melts into the waves.*So what gives, big guy?Dave Hickey: I’m retiring because my time is up.

Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Dickens, Ray Carver or David Foster Wallace. My idea is to provide professors a way of teaching creative writing without having to read quires of crap. Also, I really believe that most of the problems with literary prose tend to be statistical. They have to do with sequencing, and the calculus is helpful in gaining this sort of information. When I was in graduate school I invented a grammar based on the paragraph rather than the sentence—very radical at the time. I also had works by writers in three states of revision so I could say: the numbers are like this here, and then here and then here. So I could make empirically based observations about intention. Hemingway means to do this. Gertrude Stein means to do this. D.H. Lawrence means to do this. I was fighting against professorial Freudian and Marxist musings on the artist’s intentions. I hate all that woozy political and psychotherapeutic crap applied to books and art.I hope Dave gets cracking on this because I for one could use a new alternative to the existential gnashing of turning out Fine Prose that ain't got too much wrong with it. Also, there are a few sections from Gilbert Sorrentino's Misterioso I'd like to put through Hickey's software program for my own edification. (Though it's really Pagan America I'm setting a lantern in my window for.)What about art critics? Do they have any place in this system anymore? They used to have an influence over whether people bought things or not. Do they still have that?We have no power at all. We just market aphorisms. This is mostly because of magazine economics. Good critics are expensive. I am expensive. Academics work for free to get tenure, and, since they are worried about the approval of their colleagues, they are fearful of making value judgments. Also, most of my peers and contemporaries learned how to write magazine journalism. We know how to do a transition, we know how to do a lead, we know what a hook is, and we’re literate. Most critics today come out of art academia, where they don’t even understand the future-imperfect tense. People like me, the late Bob Hughes [see Jim Kelly's perceptive eulogy on Robert Hughes at VF Daily], Chris Knight, Peter Plagens, Jerry Saltz and Peter Schjeldahl—we’re sort of like sewing machine repairmen after the sewing machine has gone out of fashion.Wonder if Dave has read Tom Wolfe's Art Basel Miami Beach section in Back to Blood, what he thinks of it.

Last summer I wrote catalogue pieces on Ken Price and John Chamberlain. They were both my friends and my essays turned out to be inadvertent obituaries. I take this as a sign.

So no more e-mails from civilians, no more notes from John Updike or Steve Martin, no more crazy hipsters from Berkeley knocking on my door.

        "text": "The brain, says Adam Sillito, doesn't see the world as it really is. Surrounded by notionally flat paintings, which at once seem to rise out of and sink into the canvases, their patterns vibrating and jumbling across the retina, this much is clear. We have invited Sillito, a professor at University College London and director of the Institute of Ophthalmology, to survey four decades of the work of Bridget Riley, as the staff at Tate Britain make their final preparations for the opening of this major retrospective. A woman in plastic gloves is painting in the edges of a black circle canvas hanging in the entrance.It was once said of Riley that no painter, alive or dead, had made us more aware of our eyes. From the dazzling early black-and-white paintings to the gentler colour contrasts of her Egyptian palette, her work is celebrated for its disorienting optical effects. But what, deliberately or intuitively, is Riley doing to our visual perception? And why is it impossible to see Blaze, the flat canvas in front of which we are standing, as anything other than curved? \"You are unable to see it as flat,\" says Sillito. \"Your brain has learned through evolution to react to things that are in the natural world. You've learned to see things, you have a hypothesis about them, and there's an expectancy that comes from certain arrangements of stimuli. If you take this painting, anywhere in the natural world that would be a curved, non-flat surface. What Riley has done is force a dissonance, where part of your brain knows that it is flat, and another part thinks that the only interpretation that fits is if it's a curving surface.\" One of Riley's earliest pieces, Movement in Squares, depicts a chequered board of varyingly spaced squares that appear to curl into the canvas. Sillito is a huge fan of Riley, and his hands flutter affectionately across the painting. \"If you look from top to bottom your brain is constantly confused by what appears to be a pattern but is actually uneven. What you're expecting in the natural world is something that shows regularity. So as you look down, your mind tries to take a hold of it. You come up with all sorts of different hypotheses, and the whole thing seems to move before your eyes. You naturally move your eyes up and down and, as you do, they get all sorts of transitions, which confuse them. So you think there's movement, and then you think there isn't.\" What Riley exploits, he says, is her knowledge of the methods by which the brain interprets the world. \"The work of art sits between the observer and the picture. It interacts with the observer, and produces an effect on you.\" Her work goes beyond standard optical illusions, he argues. \"She's understood the processes without actually having any knowledge of what goes on in the brain. She's intuitively picked up on those things which the brain uses to make decisions about the visual world and then she plays games with them. She draws you into her world and it's much more than simply a set of visual stimuli.\" The next gallery is filled with Riley's jolting colour stripe paintings - Veld, Rattle, Late Morning. This is the artist at her most eye-ache-inducing. \"I don't quite understand these in the same way,\" says Sillito. \"If you look at it for a while, you'll find that the very bright colours 'adapt out' your visual system.\" Adapting out results in an inability to see as sensitively. It occurs, for example, if someone shines a bright light into your eye, or you enter a dim room. \"In the same way, you can adapt out components of your visual system, and then when you move your eyes, you mask some of the other colours. By looking at these vertical stripes you can adapt out those components of the visual system that process vertical stripes, and at the same time you are adapting out a colour channel, so if you move your eyes then it all jumps about.\" He tips his head sideways to view the stripes horizontally. \"But if you move your head to the side, then the bits of your brain that process horizontal information haven't been affected so you see everything OK again.\" I try it. It works. But why should it be that some of her paintings are actually uncomfortable to view? \"The brain processes form and colour separately, then puts them together later,\" he says. \"These paintings give you confusing information, which makes you feel uncomfortable because you know there's something wrong. It actually hurts to look at them after a while. It's the visual equivalent of discordant music.\" Sillito also notes that the optical effects of the works can vary depending on where one stands in relation to them. \"You can't be too close or you don't experience the full effect. The eye can't accommodate it sufficiently.\" He worries. \"I can imagine this will be a terrible exhibition to go around because there will be all these people standing a foot away from the painting.\" In the final gallery are the paintings based on the palette of colours that Riley developed after a trip to Egypt in 1979. The curator of the exhibition argues that this moment marked a shift from perception to sensation in her work, and Sillito notes that the colours are much more freely organised. \"She is using different cues here. She's moved to colour, and she's using different ways of mixing the colour to produce more subtle contrasts. She's broken out of rigid structure.\" These works are certainly easier to look at. \"They don't mess your system up in the same way,\" he says. \"These are pleasing patterns. Some of the earlier works are worrying because they produce quite big contradictions. As you look at this you can get all sorts of surfaces out of it that seem to be slanting. It does beg to be interpreted, but it's a rather easier game to play. The cues are more subtle.\" The brain can be made to see one colour differently by the arrangement of contrasting colours around it, he explains. \"We interpret every single event in the context of all the ones that go on around it. With colour, we interpret it in terms of the wavelengths that are coming back from the whole image, so you can make something appear to be a different colour by arranging the ones around it.\" Many people misunderstand what Riley's palette is, he argues. \"If you like, her palette is made up of the things that upset how you see the world and she does truly artistic things with them.\" It amounts to far more than optical distraction, he believes. \"She stands well on the aesthetic value side. She's playing very deliberate games that have nothing to do with something being an object like a vase or a face and everything to do with the mechanisms that make us see. She's taken all these special cues that the brain uses to interpret the world and put them together in a work of art.\" · Adrian Searle reviews Bridget Riley at the Tate in tomorrow's G2.

From the dazzling early black-and-white paintings to the gentler colour contrasts of her Egyptian palette, her work is celebrated for its disorienting optical effects. But what, deliberately or intuitively, is Riley doing to our visual perception? And why is it impossible to see Blaze, the flat canvas in front of which we are standing, as anything other than curved? \"You are unable to see it as flat,\" says Sillito. \"Your brain has learned through evolution to react to things that are in the natural world. You've learned to see things, you have a hypothesis about them, and there's an expectancy that comes from certain arrangements of stimuli. If you take this painting, anywhere in the natural world that would be a curved, non-flat surface. What Riley has done is force a dissonance, where part of your brain knows that it is flat, and another part thinks that the only interpretation that fits is if it's a curving surface.\" One of Riley's earliest pieces, Movement in Squares, depicts a chequered board of varyingly spaced squares that appear to curl into the canvas. Sillito is a huge fan of Riley, and his hands flutter affectionately across the painting. \"If you look from top to bottom your brain is constantly confused by what appears to be a pattern but is actually uneven. What you're expecting in the natural world is something that shows regularity. So as you look down, your mind tries to take a hold of it. You come up with all sorts of different hypotheses, and the whole thing seems to move before your eyes. You naturally move your eyes up and down and, as you do, they get all sorts of transitions, which confuse them. So you think there's movement, and then you think there isn't.\" What Riley exploits, he says, is her knowledge of the methods by which the brain interprets the world. \"The work of art sits between the observer and the picture. It interacts with the observer, and produces an effect on you.\" Her work goes beyond standard optical illusions, he argues. \"She's understood the processes without actually having any knowledge of what goes on in the brain. She's intuitively picked up on those things which the brain uses to make decisions about the visual world and then she plays games with them. She draws you into her world and it's much more than simply a set of visual stimuli.\" The next gallery is filled with Riley's jolting colour stripe paintings - Veld, Rattle, Late Morning. This is the artist at her most eye-ache-inducing. \"I don't quite understand these in the same way,\" says Sillito. \"If you look at it for a while, you'll find that the very bright colours 'adapt out' your visual system.\" Adapting out results in an inability to see as sensitively. It occurs, for example, if someone shines a bright light into your eye, or you enter a dim room. \"In the same way, you can adapt out components of your visual system, and then when you move your eyes, you mask some of the other colours. By looking at these vertical stripes you can adapt out those components of the visual system that process vertical stripes, and at the same time you are adapting out a colour channel, so if you move your eyes then it all jumps about.\" He tips his head sideways to view the stripes horizontally. \"But if you move your head to the side, then the bits of your brain that process horizontal information haven't been affected so you see everything OK again.\" I try it. It works. But why should it be that some of her paintings are actually uncomfortable to view? \"The brain processes form and colour separately, then puts them together later,\" he says. \"These paintings give you confusing information, which makes you feel uncomfortable because you know there's something wrong. It actually hurts to look at them after a while. It's the visual equivalent of discordant music.\" Sillito also notes that the optical effects of the works can vary depending on where one stands in relation to them. \"You can't be too close or you don't experience the full effect. The eye can't accommodate it sufficiently.\" He worries. \"I can imagine this will be a terrible exhibition to go around because there will be all these people standing a foot away from the painting.\" In the final gallery are the paintings based on the palette of colours that Riley developed after a trip to Egypt in 1979. The curator of the exhibition argues that this moment marked a shift from perception to sensation in her work, and Sillito notes that the colours are much more freely organised. \"She is using different cues here. She's moved to colour, and she's using different ways of mixing the colour to produce more subtle contrasts. She's broken out of rigid structure.\" These works are certainly easier to look at. \"They don't mess your system up in the same way,\" he says. \"These are pleasing patterns. Some of the earlier works are worrying because they produce quite big contradictions. As you look at this you can get all sorts of surfaces out of it that seem to be slanting. It does beg to be interpreted, but it's a rather easier game to play. The cues are more subtle.\" The brain can be made to see one colour differently by the arrangement of contrasting colours around it, he explains. \"We interpret every single event in the context of all the ones that go on around it. With colour, we interpret it in terms of the wavelengths that are coming back from the whole image, so you can make something appear to be a different colour by arranging the ones around it.\" Many people misunderstand what Riley's palette is, he argues. \"If you like, her palette is made up of the things that upset how you see the world and she does truly artistic things with them.\" It amounts to far more than optical distraction, he believes. \"She stands well on the aesthetic value side. She's playing very deliberate games that have nothing to do with something being an object like a vase or a face and everything to do with the mechanisms that make us see. She's taken all these special cues that the brain uses to interpret the world and put them together in a work of art.\" · Adrian Searle reviews Bridget Riley at the Tate in tomorrow's G2.

She never raised her voice, but it was quite clear her soft words were law.The works she has chosen include a Mantegna – which she said she has loved \"for years and years, it still thrills me,\" – three small colour sketches by Seurat and Raphael's St Catherine of Alexandria, in which she noted the blues and yellows often used in her own work, the yellow lining of the saint's cloak leading the eye upwards to a patch of pure yellow paint in the sky.\"That yellow is the divine,\" Riley said, \"the celestial light.\" She has had the wall painted the dried blood colour of the gallery where the painting normally hangs, to make it feel more at home, she explained.\"She is working at the absolute height of her powers, she has never painted better. And at 80 years old her work has nothing to do with ageing, it's full of joie de vivre, of sheer life,\" said Colin Wiggins, the gallery's head of education. \"She deserves a holiday now, but I bet she won't get one.\"Indeed no. \"I haven't been in my own studio now for some time because of this exhibition, and I feel it calling to me,\" said Riley. \"I have another exhibition opening in February in Berlin, such a lot of work to do.\"Dame Bridget Riley thinks the very quintessence of her art is currently occupying one entire wall in the National Gallery in London. A parade of identically sized black circles across a plain white background, the work seems to – out of the corner of the viewer's eye – spin and intertwine and generate colours.Bridget Riley\"In a way it is almost the one essential thing about my work. If there's one thing that I am about, it would be there, Composition with Circles 7,\" said Riley.So it must be a source of anguish to the gallery's director, Nicholas Penny, that, in six months time, he is going to have to destroy the work as well as the sinuously colourful version of her 2008 piece Arcadia on the opposite wall. Both have been painted by Riley and her team directly on to the walls, and will disappear with the end of the exhibition on 22 May.\"I'm not going to be here,\" Penny said . \"I will not be here.\"Riley, who has been one of the most revered living British artists since the 1960s, last curated an exhibition of her favourite works at the National Gallery 21 years ago.
