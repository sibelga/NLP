The artist’s vast, eclectic collection of images-news photographs, advertisements, color swatches, and amateur photos that Richter began gathering in the early 1960s-works as source material for some of his paintings, such as Uncle Rudi, his 1965 depiction of a young German soldier (the artist’s uncle in an SS trench jacket) or his 1988 series showing the events surrounding the deaths of members of the Red Army Faction. This archive, however, is widely considered a work of art in its own right. “It is both a collection of images as well as a biographical project,” the publisher said on the phone from his office in Cologne. “It is not about his work; it is his whole biography, his cosmos, his family. It is all in there.” While Atlas has been available in smaller print versions since the late 1990s, the new König edition makes the work newly visible with some 828 pages in four volumes, with more than 5,000 images reworked by the artist. The plates are printed in a huge folio format to capture each rich detail. Richter, born in 1932, fled East Germany in 1961, months before the construction of the Berlin Wall. His complex relationship with personal, advertising, and newspaper photography can be seen in his paintings, which since the early 1960s often seem to blur or distort the ostensible authority of the photographic image. Art historian Benjamin H.D. Buchloh has compared Richter’s Atlas in its scope and importance to André Malraux’s Le Musée Imaginaire, Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project, and Aby Warburg’s Mnemosyne Atlas-archives that conflate social and personal memory. Says the American artist Matt Saunders of encountering Atlas for the first time as a student in the 1990s: “Atlas untied the knot of the artist’s sketchbook, offering a fresh model of the artist moving through, seeing, and recording the world-no more perching awkwardly, conspicuously, pencil in hand. It was exciting to realize one could represent life by snapshotting, gathering, and sorting.” König compares Atlas to another kind of archival work: “[Marcel] Duchamp’s Boîte-en-valise,” that portable version of the artist’s oeuvre. The Atlas lets us see Richter tracking the photographic image-political and personal, in advertisement and art-across a tumultuous half century.

        "text": "A new gallery of contemporary art opens its soaring glass doors this week – or rather, an old one is controversially reborn. The renowned John Hansard Gallery, once out on the verges of Southampton University, to which it belongs, has moved into a specially designed building in the city centre. The exterior and interior are the work of two different architects, the developer went bust and too many cooks were involved in the broth. To describe the project as a long story would be the merest understatement: it has been going on for nearly 20 years.But the good news is that the bad news – the exterior – doesn’t matter. Outside is an undistinguished shop-front of grey bricks speckled with sporadic beige, the default look of so much of today’s high-rise housing (the gallery morphs into flats at the back). Standing opposite is its exact twin, the Nuffield theatre, separated only by a narrow alley of tapas bars. The signage is hideously civic and almost comically inadequate for such important institutions. The name is absurd – why call these two entirely separate venues (three if you count the film charity City Eye) Studio 144? And both the theatre and the main galleries are hoisted up above more cafes and restaurants, as if they could hardly stand on their own two feet.But the interior of the new JHG is as well suited to contemporary art as anything launched in those two decades, from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to the Jerwood in Hastings. Indeed, for art lovers, the south coast is an ever-growing chain of beacons: from Margate, with its exceptional programme, to the Folkestone Triennial and the impressively adventurous De La Warr in Bexhill-on-Sea; from the great Towner Gallery in Eastbourne (its funding recently, disastrously, threatened by its own council) to Pallant House in Chichester, with its museum-class British art shows; and onward now to Southampton.Considering that Southampton already has its venerable City Art Gallery, housed in the neoclassical Civic Centre, with a permanent collection running from Turner and Monet to Chris Ofili and currently showing George Shaw’s terrific My Back to Nature, you might say the city centre is already rich in art. But unlike practically every other gallery in the world, this one doesn’t open on a Sunday. So there is even more scope for the JHG, which is aiming for six times the modest visitor figures of its campus days.There is underfloor heating for cold weather, a vividly appealing children’s suite and panoramic windows in two spaces to lure a curious public in from the main boulevard outside. The decor is standard white cube – polished concrete, glass, steel and selected Scandinavian wood floors – but the configuration of galleries is excellent. Small rooms open into larger galleries and finally into a colossal double-height prism of a space with picture windows the size of a multiplex screen overlooking the wide piazza below. Crowds gather and disperse, children run, skateboarders race across the pale Portland stone to the colonnaded Guildhall opposite. It’s like being in a box at some vast public theatre.For its inaugural show, the curators have chosen the German art star Gerhard Richter (born 1932). With two-dozen works (or 275, if you include all the panels in two major installations) running all the way back to 1977, this is effectively a condensed retrospective. And because Richter is famously questioning of all the usual distinctions in painting – figurative versus abstract, mechanical reproduction versus painterly touch and so on – it’s a particularly judicious selection. Gerhard Richter at the John Hansard Gallery. Photograph: Nigel Green His Mirror paintings, in which pigment adheres to glass, are shiningly reflective in outward appearance yet inherently opaque. Look into them, drawn by their greens, greys and blues, and you see yourself doubled, then mistily silhouetted (they are angled in pairs in gallery corners). The colour recedes and so does the clarity of your own visage.Mustang Squadron shows an array of warplanes flying in formation, in silent black and white. Close by it hangs 14 Feb 45, an aerial image of a cityscape that one cannot quite make out.

Gerhard Richter is at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, until 18 August A new gallery of contemporary art opens its soaring glass doors this week – or rather, an old one is controversially reborn. The renowned John Hansard Gallery, once out on the verges of Southampton University, to which it belongs, has moved into a specially designed building in the city centre. The exterior and interior are the work of two different architects, the developer went bust and too many cooks were involved in the broth. To describe the project as a long story would be the merest understatement: it has been going on for nearly 20 years.But the good news is that the bad news – the exterior – doesn’t matter. Outside is an undistinguished shop-front of grey bricks speckled with sporadic beige, the default look of so much of today’s high-rise housing (the gallery morphs into flats at the back). Standing opposite is its exact twin, the Nuffield theatre, separated only by a narrow alley of tapas bars. The signage is hideously civic and almost comically inadequate for such important institutions. The name is absurd – why call these two entirely separate venues (three if you count the film charity City Eye) Studio 144? And both the theatre and the main galleries are hoisted up above more cafes and restaurants, as if they could hardly stand on their own two feet.But the interior of the new JHG is as well suited to contemporary art as anything launched in those two decades, from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to the Jerwood in Hastings. Indeed, for art lovers, the south coast is an ever-growing chain of beacons: from Margate, with its exceptional programme, to the Folkestone Triennial and the impressively adventurous De La Warr in Bexhill-on-Sea; from the great Towner Gallery in Eastbourne (its funding recently, disastrously, threatened by its own council) to Pallant House in Chichester, with its museum-class British art shows; and onward now to Southampton.Considering that Southampton already has its venerable City Art Gallery, housed in the neoclassical Civic Centre, with a permanent collection running from Turner and Monet to Chris Ofili and currently showing George Shaw’s terrific My Back to Nature, you might say the city centre is already rich in art. But unlike practically every other gallery in the world, this one doesn’t open on a Sunday. So there is even more scope for the JHG, which is aiming for six times the modest visitor figures of its campus days.There is underfloor heating for cold weather, a vividly appealing children’s suite and panoramic windows in two spaces to lure a curious public in from the main boulevard outside. The decor is standard white cube – polished concrete, glass, steel and selected Scandinavian wood floors – but the configuration of galleries is excellent. Small rooms open into larger galleries and finally into a colossal double-height prism of a space with picture windows the size of a multiplex screen overlooking the wide piazza below. Crowds gather and disperse, children run, skateboarders race across the pale Portland stone to the colonnaded Guildhall opposite. It’s like being in a box at some vast public theatre.For its inaugural show, the curators have chosen the German art star Gerhard Richter (born 1932). With two-dozen works (or 275, if you include all the panels in two major installations) running all the way back to 1977, this is effectively a condensed retrospective. And because Richter is famously questioning of all the usual distinctions in painting – figurative versus abstract, mechanical reproduction versus painterly touch and so on – it’s a particularly judicious selection.

        "text": "Is the art world a flashy suburb of Wall Street? You might think so, to listen to artists talking among themselves about money and career. Russian oligarchs lavishing millions, personal styles touted as “brands,” the globalization of the marketplace—Have you been to Dubai?—museum curators joining commercial galleries for serious money, art fairs opening tomorrow, auction records set only to be set again. Oh, that bubbly air. That celebrity perfume. Such a shiny-faced world cries out for resistance, but it also begs for something else. A portrait.In that spirit, Vanity Fair decided to conduct a straw poll. Or maybe it should be called a silk poll. Ask 100 art-world worthies—mainly artists, professors of art, and curators (but not dealers, who must look after their own)—to name whom they consider to be the six most important living artists. Then ask a writer to sketch a portrait of the results. The intent was not to identify once and for all the six most important living artists. No one can know that. The point was to picture contemporary taste and capture the reflection off the sheen of the period. (More Van Dyck, in short, than Rembrandt.) And to ask, as one always does with portraits: Is the dress all that matters? What lies behind moneyed eyes?And the envelope, please …The German painter Gerhard Richter is today our most admired living artist, having received 24 votes. Jasper Johns comes next with 20 votes, followed by Richard Serra with 19. Bruce Nauman (17), Cindy Sherman (12), and Ellsworth Kelly (10) complete the top six. John Baldessari, Jeff Koons, William Kentridge, and Ai Weiwei each received five votes. David Hammons, Brice Marden, Ed Ruscha, James Turrell, and Kara Walker received four votes.A different group of voters, of course, might have picked different artists. (The voter pool selected by the Vanity Fair editors tended toward the older, American, and mainstream.) Of the roughly 100 asked to vote, more than half (54) did so. That’s more than I would have expected. It’s natural not to want to “judge” artists; Mark di Suvero responded by explaining, “I do not believe in ranking artists. Art is for life.” It’s also natural to arch an eyebrow at the low pop appeal of lists. (Jasper Johns offered an elegant demurral, writing “Regrets” on the editor’s invitation to participate in the poll.) But compiling lists can also be a useful parlor game, forcing one to make difficult distinctions and clarify murky values. I admired those with the courage to make a call. Besides, they risked making six friends now—and a thousand enemies forever.What portrait emerges? There is no single look to the art or common countenance to the sensibility of the artists who top the list, each of whom can be viewed in a variety of ways. But there is a powerful shared preoccupation with, to put it as nakedly as possible, “I.” In a period whose presiding spiritual disease is narcissism, the artists we most admire play, seriously, with what we can know about who we think we are. Me, myself, and I—the modern trinity—has rarely seemed less fixed or certain.Of the names near the top, I was first intrigued by Serra and Sherman. It’s no surprise Serra did well. He is the world’s most celebrated living sculptor. But he struck me as somehow different from the others. A declarative artist with a dominating and assertive eye—and “I”—Serra was one of only two respondents in the poll to vote for himself. (The other was the New York-based collective known as Bruce High Quality Foundation.) I would have been disappointed if Serra hadn’t voted for himself. He can be subtle but is no pussyfooter, and his monumental scale, masculine bravura, and capture of the space between the dangerous and the fine seem to recall another, less ironic day than our own. The man who made Tilted Arc and Snake seems close to Jackson Pollock and the boys at the Cedar Bar in the 50s. Before a Serra, I imagine Andy Warhol going, “Wowww,” and Roy Lichtenstein painting Pow!At first glance, Serra might seem an ideal poster boy for a solipsistic age. But his art—on second glance—takes on a very different aspect: It appears steeped in richly disturbing reflections about human scale. Its edgy weight actually offers a dramatic counterpoint to the loose and airy inflations of contemporary culture. Some Serras are overweening and threatening, as if their rusty metal mass might muscle in upon you; some squeeze viewers into a labyrinth. They cut down to size all the little “I”s who busily strut and fret their hour upon the postmodern stage. On the Vanity Fair list no other artist has this bold stance. Instead, most prefer the elusive and filtered, cultivating something conceptual, ironic, and distant. What they share with Serra, however, is an equally uneasy and provocative quality of “I.”Cindy Sherman, at 59, is younger than all of the others in the top six and the only woman (about which more in a moment). If Serra seems all boy, Sherman’s all girl. But, much like Serra, she makes work that puts enormous and sophisticated pressure on our sense of the individual “I.” She’s always playing dress-up, and her art really is about the dress. But not in an old-fashioned way. Sherman portrays a society that can see individuals only through rapidly shuffled forms of stereotype, performance, and disguise. The dress-up is all the more pointed—existentially—when Sherman uses herself as her own model or doll. In her early “Untitled Film Stills,” she did not just copy an actress or celebrity, the way teenagers do; she seemed to capture the soul in a role. (She would understand those tribesmen who, fearing that their souls will be stolen, don’t wish to be photographed.) In her later work she shows more slippage—and wreckage—between mask and model.Both Gerhard Richter and Jasper Johns are highly personal painters, but with selves so seriously slippery that you can find them only in losing them. Richter is a chameleon who, like Sherman taking on a role, can enter into any style of painting and assume its essential character. He can be a calm realist or, if he wants, an explosive Abstract Expressionist. He can be a public painter with political intent or an intimiste fascinated by private detail. Among the many remarkable things about Richter is that, taking his work as a whole, he does not seem to play any easy conceptual game with his shifting styles. He does not diminish any of his approaches by suggesting that he’s engaged in parody or pastiche or dress-up or braggadocio. He contains contraries, as if no single net can capture the whole truth. Richter’s art is so wide that its center is hard to locate, or, more interesting still, not necessarily there.Johns is no less distinctive—and elusive. His painterly hand is typically commented upon and admired. His touch is unusually personal; the brushwork suggests he’s right there with you. Touch itself is often described as the earliest and most essential sensation, our first connection to the world. But Johns is not sentimental about connection. The Johns hand enlivens but does not possess whatever it touches. It never holds down a meaning or thought. A word is not only a word; a flag is not only a flag; a map is not only a map. You are not only you, and I am not only me. In the 1950s, Johns’s American flags turned Stars-and-Stripes certainty into a question. His subsequent work, marinated in personal symbols and iconography, makes a question of himself. Over time, in a culture that can hardly remember yesterday, Johns, at 83, has become the master of the revisited. He enjoys the momentary touch of memory, but knows it changes even in the remembering.Johns makes puzzles of the self. So do other artists on the list. John Baldessari, who is sometimes called a conceptual artist, is more precisely a conundrum artist. He’s a philosophical joker, blessed with a fine cynicism, slipping joker-like between the playing cards of statements, mediums, and genres and using them together to leave you—leave you what?—hanging on a question. (What Is Painting is a Baldessari painting.) Like Johns and Baldessari, Bruce Nauman, who did particularly well in the vote, also likes to de-stabilize clichés and unsettle the settled self. For many people, Nauman has come to embody, I think, what artistic practice should ideally be in today’s world. He is not confined to any medium, but adapts his methods to his meanings, shifting easily among performance, video, and installations. There is sometimes a nice American deadpan to his work—as in the neon Run from Fear, Fun from Rear—that keeps the solemn, sleepy, and pretentious at bay. And in his more recent art, he has emphasized with visceral power the fragmentary and partial, as if we were now torn and scattered across the landscape.Some artists apply enormous historical pressure to the individual self. Historical memory here becomes more menacing and abstract than the personal reveries of Johns; the burden of the past threatens entirely to overwhelm and smother the capital “I.” The dancing silhouettes with which the African-American artist Kara Walker works not only have a historical flavor but also tellingly represent the flattened, partial, and cut-up sensibilities of oppressed people. The figures in the rough-hewn charcoal animations of the South African William Kentridge appear pressed and twisted by invisible historical hands and smudged with guilt. The Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei and the African-American artist David Hammons hurl themselves—often in performance—into their cultures as if to show that the individual can and must confront the historical stereotypes of, say, racism or Communist conformity. But Hammons and Weiwei also attack both the shiny art world and consumer culture for suppressing the individual and imposing stereotypes.There are a few artists in the top 15 who might superficially seem to have little or no interest in narcissism and the uneasy “I.” And yet, one of the main desires today is to escape the solipsistic prison—through, to cite one example, meditation. A wish to escape does not necessarily imply any lack of me-me-me. T. S. Eliot was here first, with his celebrated observation “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.” Ellsworth Kelly’s abstract paintings offer precisely that escape, as do James Turrell’s meditations on light. Brice Marden would never impose on silence. And I would argue that much of the pleasure we derive from Ed Ruscha comes from the way he empties out Pop America, leaving behind something innocent.In a society portrait, who and what has been left off a list—or snubbed, or retired to a distant corner—is no less telling than who occupies the center table.Most surprising to me was how few women received votes. Jeez Louise! In fact, if the two grand Louises were still alive (Bourgeois and Nevelson), they would surely have added to the numbers; the same goes for Joan Mitchell. As it stands, women artists received less than 25 percent of the total number of votes cast; only two women had a place in the top 15. This result comes 50 years after the postwar women’s movement began in earnest in New York, which was the capital of the art world. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised. Last spring, the Robert Miller Gallery staged an old-fashioned panel called “Gender Politics in the Arts,” during which Laurie Simmons, a panelist and a veteran of the New York art world, suddenly veered off topic. Gender? Today, she said, artists talk about nothing but money.At the same time, some big-name and ubiquitous postmoderns, never far from the discussion about contemporary art, fared poorly; perhaps too much love and hate lead, finally, to ho-hum. Damien Hirst, who aspired with his platinum-and-diamond skull to create the symbol of our age, received three votes. Dead meat? Kitsch-meister Jeff Koons received a respectable—respectability can be an affront—five votes. Richard Prince, one vote.Papa Painting showed his age. Nowadays, painting is often not what those of us who love it think of as painting, but just another form of conceptual art. Many art critics do not focus upon this medium anymore, though it can still do well in the marketplace if it is well positioned (or hung). It’s true that Richter, Johns, and Kelly were in the top six, with Brice Marden not too far behind. But you can feel the age and—sorry for this, but sports analogies are required when you talk about lists—there’s not much depth on the bench. After Richter, other much-discussed German painters, such as Anselm Kiefer (3), A. R. Penck (0), and Neo Rauch (1), did not do well. And Robert Ryman was overlooked altogether. Exclude an abstract artist as gifted as Ryman? You can only imagine the situation of more traditional painters. Among those who take seriously what one usually associates with traditional painting, Antonio López García received two votes and David Hockney three. Perhaps painting is now moving to the side, as poetry has, to cultivate its private garden.Frank Stella did not receive a single vote, which is astonishing if one has any institutional memory. In the 1970s, Stella was top fella at the Museum of Modern Art. He was widely regarded as the anointed successor—in the grand, art-historical narrative of progressive modernist painting—of Pollock and Barnett Newman. Some would say the waning of his reputation stems from weakness in his later work, but I disagree. (Many have also grumbled about Johns’s late work, but he did well in the poll.) Stella is a victim of the collapse of confidence in a modernist narrative that emphasizes a this-begat-that progression of style. Had he continued to make the sort of art he made in the 1960s and 1970s, he might now be perceived, as Donald Judd is, as one of the last great moderns in that story. A celebrated period piece. I admire Stella for moving on.What has happened to Stella—cut out from today’s portrait—suggests that you should remain wary of shifting fashions in taste, particularly in a period like ours that does not have powerful convictions about how best to measure art of enduring value. (Imagine if Richter were to strike out in a Vanity Fair poll 30 years from now. Impossible? Well, Stella’s reputation in 1975 was as strong as Richter’s position now.) Another example: some of the reigning artists of the 1980s and 1990s did poorly. There was a time when you could not escape the names of Julian Schnabel (0), David Salle (1), and Francesco Clemente (0). However, if taste is fickle, it also makes sense to prepare for re-appraisals. Perhaps Stella will be a hit at the Museum of Modern Art once again, in 2025.Apart from painting, other genres also aroused less excitement than I would have anticipated. Few people who specialize in photography were asked to vote in the poll, but, even so, the lack of mainstream enthusiasm for photography is noteworthy. (Is photography a woman?) Robert Frank, the Swiss who did so much to define postwar America, did not get one vote. Nor did many talented American photographers who came of age in the later decades of the 20th century. Recently, some Continental photographers have emerged—such as Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth—who deftly capture the strangely warm/cool, vacant, and surreally disconnected character of many postmodern places. They received few votes. Indifference toward performance art is more easily explained, since it’s an idealistic genre that’s not easily seen or collected. (So much in the doing, so little in the done.) But its evanescent spirit, together with its emphasis on the body and role-playing, does offer a brilliant platform from which to address and critique a narcissistic culture. Nauman, Hammons, and Weiwei are social performers, to be sure, but I would have guessed that Marina Abramović—recently the subject of a wildly successful retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art—would have received more than three votes.No doubt many respected artists who received few or no votes would have done better if the voters had been asked to name 10 rather than 6 artists. But establishing a cutoff was the point: it forced voters to define this moment’s priorities. The rather weak showing of artists who can be easily defined—as a “painter,” for example, or a “photographer”—is a defining part of the portrait. (Those artists would have done better in a larger sampling.) What, after all, would you call Nauman, Sherman, or Hammons? What is Weiwei? Or Kentridge? Are Baldessari and Ruscha only painters? Conceptual art doesn’t cover it. The phrase is a meaningless catchall. The preference for artists who are not tied to one genre or another, or who move among genres, reflects an impatience with customary boundaries and scales, perhaps because staying within the lines seems an insufficient response to today’s world. Floaters—and Richter and Johns, despite being painters, have a lot of “float” in their sensibilities—can more easily piece together a postmodern “I” that seems to fit the moment.Several people indicated that they would have liked to vote for artists who died young or who have died recently—but whose work remains a vital part of this moment. They’re right. Certain ghosts are necessary to complete the society portrait. Two in particular. Cy Twombly, whose quixotic line always seems to escape. And Andy Warhol, our particular mirror.Is the art world a flashy suburb of Wall Street? You might think so, to listen to artists talking among themselves about money and career. Russian oligarchs lavishing millions, personal styles touted as “brands,” the globalization of the marketplace—Have you been to Dubai?—museum curators joining commercial galleries for serious money, art fairs opening tomorrow, auction records set only to be set again. Oh, that bubbly air. That celebrity perfume. Such a shiny-faced world cries out for resistance, but it also begs for something else. A portrait.In that spirit, Vanity Fair decided to conduct a straw poll. Or maybe it should be called a silk poll. Ask 100 art-world worthies—mainly artists, professors of art, and curators (but not dealers, who must look after their own)—to name whom they consider to be the six most important living artists. Then ask a writer to sketch a portrait of the results. The intent was not to identify once and for all the six most important living artists. No one can know that. The point was to picture contemporary taste and capture the reflection off the sheen of the period. (More Van Dyck, in short, than Rembrandt.) And to ask, as one always does with portraits: Is the dress all that matters? What lies behind moneyed eyes?And the envelope, please …The German painter Gerhard Richter is today our most admired living artist, having received 24 votes. Jasper Johns comes next with 20 votes, followed by Richard Serra with 19. Bruce Nauman (17), Cindy Sherman (12), and Ellsworth Kelly (10) complete the top six. John Baldessari, Jeff Koons, William Kentridge, and Ai Weiwei each received five votes. David Hammons, Brice Marden, Ed Ruscha, James Turrell, and Kara Walker received four votes.A different group of voters, of course, might have picked different artists. (The voter pool selected by the Vanity Fair editors tended toward the older, American, and mainstream.) Of the roughly 100 asked to vote, more than half (54) did so. That’s more than I would have expected. It’s natural not to want to “judge” artists; Mark di Suvero responded by explaining, “I do not believe in ranking artists. Art is for life.” It’s also natural to arch an eyebrow at the low pop appeal of lists. (Jasper Johns offered an elegant demurral, writing “Regrets” on the editor’s invitation to participate in the poll.) But compiling lists can also be a useful parlor game, forcing one to make difficult distinctions and clarify murky values. I admired those with the courage to make a call. Besides, they risked making six friends now—and a thousand enemies forever.What portrait emerges? There is no single look to the art or common countenance to the sensibility of the artists who top the list, each of whom can be viewed in a variety of ways. But there is a powerful shared preoccupation with, to put it as nakedly as possible, “I.” In a period whose presiding spiritual disease is narcissism, the artists we most admire play, seriously, with what we can know about who we think we are. Me, myself, and I—the modern trinity—has rarely seemed less fixed or certain.Of the names near the top, I was first intrigued by Serra and Sherman. It’s no surprise Serra did well. He is the world’s most celebrated living sculptor. But he struck me as somehow different from the others. A declarative artist with a dominating and assertive eye—and “I”—Serra was one of only two respondents in the poll to vote for himself. (The other was the New York-based collective known as Bruce High Quality Foundation.) I would have been disappointed if Serra hadn’t voted for himself. He can be subtle but is no pussyfooter, and his monumental scale, masculine bravura, and capture of the space between the dangerous and the fine seem to recall another, less ironic day than our own. The man who made Tilted Arc and Snake seems close to Jackson Pollock and the boys at the Cedar Bar in the 50s. Before a Serra, I imagine Andy Warhol going, “Wowww,” and Roy Lichtenstein painting Pow!At first glance, Serra might seem an ideal poster boy for a solipsistic age. But his art—on second glance—takes on a very different aspect: It appears steeped in richly disturbing reflections about human scale. Its edgy weight actually offers a dramatic counterpoint to the loose and airy inflations of contemporary culture. Some Serras are overweening and threatening, as if their rusty metal mass might muscle in upon you; some squeeze viewers into a labyrinth. They cut down to size all the little “I”s who busily strut and fret their hour upon the postmodern stage. On the Vanity Fair list no other artist has this bold stance. Instead, most prefer the elusive and filtered, cultivating something conceptual, ironic, and distant. What they share with Serra, however, is an equally uneasy and provocative quality of “I.”Cindy Sherman, at 59, is younger than all of the others in the top six and the only woman (about which more in a moment). If Serra seems all boy, Sherman’s all girl. But, much like Serra, she makes work that puts enormous and sophisticated pressure on our sense of the individual “I.” She’s always playing dress-up, and her art really is about the dress. But not in an old-fashioned way. Sherman portrays a society that can see individuals only through rapidly shuffled forms of stereotype, performance, and disguise. The dress-up is all the more pointed—existentially—when Sherman uses herself as her own model or doll. In her early “Untitled Film Stills,” she did not just copy an actress or celebrity, the way teenagers do; she seemed to capture the soul in a role. (She would understand those tribesmen who, fearing that their souls will be stolen, don’t wish to be photographed.) In her later work she shows more slippage—and wreckage—between mask and model.Both Gerhard Richter and Jasper Johns are highly personal painters, but with selves so seriously slippery that you can find them only in losing them. Richter is a chameleon who, like Sherman taking on a role, can enter into any style of painting and assume its essential character. He can be a calm realist or, if he wants, an explosive Abstract Expressionist. He can be a public painter with political intent or an intimiste fascinated by private detail. Among the many remarkable things about Richter is that, taking his work as a whole, he does not seem to play any easy conceptual game with his shifting styles. He does not diminish any of his approaches by suggesting that he’s engaged in parody or pastiche or dress-up or braggadocio. He contains contraries, as if no single net can capture the whole truth. Richter’s art is so wide that its center is hard to locate, or, more interesting still, not necessarily there.Johns is no less distinctive—and elusive. His painterly hand is typically commented upon and admired. His touch is unusually personal; the brushwork suggests he’s right there with you. Touch itself is often described as the earliest and most essential sensation, our first connection to the world. But Johns is not sentimental about connection. The Johns hand enlivens but does not possess whatever it touches. It never holds down a meaning or thought. A word is not only a word; a flag is not only a flag; a map is not only a map. You are not only you, and I am not only me. In the 1950s, Johns’s American flags turned Stars-and-Stripes certainty into a question.

His subsequent work, marinated in personal symbols and iconography, makes a question of himself. Over time, in a culture that can hardly remember yesterday, Johns, at 83, has become the master of the revisited. He enjoys the momentary touch of memory, but knows it changes even in the remembering.Johns makes puzzles of the self. So do other artists on the list. John Baldessari, who is sometimes called a conceptual artist, is more precisely a conundrum artist. He’s a philosophical joker, blessed with a fine cynicism, slipping joker-like between the playing cards of statements, mediums, and genres and using them together to leave you—leave you what?—hanging on a question. (What Is Painting is a Baldessari painting.) Like Johns and Baldessari, Bruce Nauman, who did particularly well in the vote, also likes to de-stabilize clichés and unsettle the settled self. For many people, Nauman has come to embody, I think, what artistic practice should ideally be in today’s world. He is not confined to any medium, but adapts his methods to his meanings, shifting easily among performance, video, and installations. There is sometimes a nice American deadpan to his work—as in the neon Run from Fear, Fun from Rear—that keeps the solemn, sleepy, and pretentious at bay. And in his more recent art, he has emphasized with visceral power the fragmentary and partial, as if we were now torn and scattered across the landscape.Some artists apply enormous historical pressure to the individual self. Historical memory here becomes more menacing and abstract than the personal reveries of Johns; the burden of the past threatens entirely to overwhelm and smother the capital “I.” The dancing silhouettes with which the African-American artist Kara Walker works not only have a historical flavor but also tellingly represent the flattened, partial, and cut-up sensibilities of oppressed people. The figures in the rough-hewn charcoal animations of the South African William Kentridge appear pressed and twisted by invisible historical hands and smudged with guilt. The Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei and the African-American artist David Hammons hurl themselves—often in performance—into their cultures as if to show that the individual can and must confront the historical stereotypes of, say, racism or Communist conformity. But Hammons and Weiwei also attack both the shiny art world and consumer culture for suppressing the individual and imposing stereotypes.There are a few artists in the top 15 who might superficially seem to have little or no interest in narcissism and the uneasy “I.” And yet, one of the main desires today is to escape the solipsistic prison—through, to cite one example, meditation. A wish to escape does not necessarily imply any lack of me-me-me. T. S. Eliot was here first, with his celebrated observation “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.” Ellsworth Kelly’s abstract paintings offer precisely that escape, as do James Turrell’s meditations on light. Brice Marden would never impose on silence. And I would argue that much of the pleasure we derive from Ed Ruscha comes from the way he empties out Pop America, leaving behind something innocent.In a society portrait, who and what has been left off a list—or snubbed, or retired to a distant corner—is no less telling than who occupies the center table.Most surprising to me was how few women received votes. Jeez Louise! In fact, if the two grand Louises were still alive (Bourgeois and Nevelson), they would surely have added to the numbers; the same goes for Joan Mitchell. As it stands, women artists received less than 25 percent of the total number of votes cast; only two women had a place in the top 15. This result comes 50 years after the postwar women’s movement began in earnest in New York, which was the capital of the art world. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised. Last spring, the Robert Miller Gallery staged an old-fashioned panel called “Gender Politics in the Arts,” during which Laurie Simmons, a panelist and a veteran of the New York art world, suddenly veered off topic. Gender? Today, she said, artists talk about nothing but money.At the same time, some big-name and ubiquitous postmoderns, never far from the discussion about contemporary art, fared poorly; perhaps too much love and hate lead, finally, to ho-hum. Damien Hirst, who aspired with his platinum-and-diamond skull to create the symbol of our age, received three votes. Dead meat? Kitsch-meister Jeff Koons received a respectable—respectability can be an affront—five votes. Richard Prince, one vote.Papa Painting showed his age. Nowadays, painting is often not what those of us who love it think of as painting, but just another form of conceptual art. Many art critics do not focus upon this medium anymore, though it can still do well in the marketplace if it is well positioned (or hung). It’s true that Richter, Johns, and Kelly were in the top six, with Brice Marden not too far behind. But you can feel the age and—sorry for this, but sports analogies are required when you talk about lists—there’s not much depth on the bench. After Richter, other much-discussed German painters, such as Anselm Kiefer (3), A. R. Penck (0), and Neo Rauch (1), did not do well. And Robert Ryman was overlooked altogether. Exclude an abstract artist as gifted as Ryman? You can only imagine the situation of more traditional painters. Among those who take seriously what one usually associates with traditional painting, Antonio López García received two votes and David Hockney three. Perhaps painting is now moving to the side, as poetry has, to cultivate its private garden.Frank Stella did not receive a single vote, which is astonishing if one has any institutional memory. In the 1970s, Stella was top fella at the Museum of Modern Art. He was widely regarded as the anointed successor—in the grand, art-historical narrative of progressive modernist painting—of Pollock and Barnett Newman. Some would say the waning of his reputation stems from weakness in his later work, but I disagree. (Many have also grumbled about Johns’s late work, but he did well in the poll.) Stella is a victim of the collapse of confidence in a modernist narrative that emphasizes a this-begat-that progression of style. Had he continued to make the sort of art he made in the 1960s and 1970s, he might now be perceived, as Donald Judd is, as one of the last great moderns in that story. A celebrated period piece. I admire Stella for moving on.What has happened to Stella—cut out from today’s portrait—suggests that you should remain wary of shifting fashions in taste, particularly in a period like ours that does not have powerful convictions about how best to measure art of enduring value. (Imagine if Richter were to strike out in a Vanity Fair poll 30 years from now. Impossible? Well, Stella’s reputation in 1975 was as strong as Richter’s position now.) Another example: some of the reigning artists of the 1980s and 1990s did poorly. There was a time when you could not escape the names of Julian Schnabel (0), David Salle (1), and Francesco Clemente (0). However, if taste is fickle, it also makes sense to prepare for re-appraisals. Perhaps Stella will be a hit at the Museum of Modern Art once again, in 2025.Apart from painting, other genres also aroused less excitement than I would have anticipated. Few people who specialize in photography were asked to vote in the poll, but, even so, the lack of mainstream enthusiasm for photography is noteworthy. (Is photography a woman?) Robert Frank, the Swiss who did so much to define postwar America, did not get one vote. Nor did many talented American photographers who came of age in the later decades of the 20th century. Recently, some Continental photographers have emerged—such as Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth—who deftly capture the strangely warm/cool, vacant, and surreally disconnected character of many postmodern places. They received few votes. Indifference toward performance art is more easily explained, since it’s an idealistic genre that’s not easily seen or collected. (So much in the doing, so little in the done.) But its evanescent spirit, together with its emphasis on the body and role-playing, does offer a brilliant platform from which to address and critique a narcissistic culture. Nauman, Hammons, and Weiwei are social performers, to be sure, but I would have guessed that Marina Abramović—recently the subject of a wildly successful retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art—would have received more than three votes.No doubt many respected artists who received few or no votes would have done better if the voters had been asked to name 10 rather than 6 artists. But establishing a cutoff was the point: it forced voters to define this moment’s priorities. The rather weak showing of artists who can be easily defined—as a “painter,” for example, or a “photographer”—is a defining part of the portrait. (Those artists would have done better in a larger sampling.) What, after all, would you call Nauman, Sherman, or Hammons? What is Weiwei? Or Kentridge? Are Baldessari and Ruscha only painters? Conceptual art doesn’t cover it. The phrase is a meaningless catchall. The preference for artists who are not tied to one genre or another, or who move among genres, reflects an impatience with customary boundaries and scales, perhaps because staying within the lines seems an insufficient response to today’s world. Floaters—and Richter and Johns, despite being painters, have a lot of “float” in their sensibilities—can more easily piece together a postmodern “I” that seems to fit the moment.Several people indicated that they would have liked to vote for artists who died young or who have died recently—but whose work remains a vital part of this moment. They’re right. Certain ghosts are necessary to complete the society portrait. Two in particular. Cy Twombly, whose quixotic line always seems to escape. And Andy Warhol, our particular mirror.Is the art world a flashy suburb of Wall Street? You might think so, to listen to artists talking among themselves about money and career. Russian oligarchs lavishing millions, personal styles touted as “brands,” the globalization of the marketplace—Have you been to Dubai?—museum curators joining commercial galleries for serious money, art fairs opening tomorrow, auction records set only to be set again. Oh, that bubbly air. That celebrity perfume. Such a shiny-faced world cries out for resistance, but it also begs for something else. A portrait.In that spirit, Vanity Fair decided to conduct a straw poll. Or maybe it should be called a silk poll. Ask 100 art-world worthies—mainly artists, professors of art, and curators (but not dealers, who must look after their own)—to name whom they consider to be the six most important living artists. Then ask a writer to sketch a portrait of the results. The intent was not to identify once and for all the six most important living artists. No one can know that. The point was to picture contemporary taste and capture the reflection off the sheen of the period. (More Van Dyck, in short, than Rembrandt.) And to ask, as one always does with portraits: Is the dress all that matters? What lies behind moneyed eyes?And the envelope, please …The German painter Gerhard Richter is today our most admired living artist, having received 24 votes. Jasper Johns comes next with 20 votes, followed by Richard Serra with 19. Bruce Nauman (17), Cindy Sherman (12), and Ellsworth Kelly (10) complete the top six. John Baldessari, Jeff Koons, William Kentridge, and Ai Weiwei each received five votes. David Hammons, Brice Marden, Ed Ruscha, James Turrell, and Kara Walker received four votes.A different group of voters, of course, might have picked different artists. (The voter pool selected by the Vanity Fair editors tended toward the older, American, and mainstream.) Of the roughly 100 asked to vote, more than half (54) did so. That’s more than I would have expected. It’s natural not to want to “judge” artists; Mark di Suvero responded by explaining, “I do not believe in ranking artists. Art is for life.” It’s also natural to arch an eyebrow at the low pop appeal of lists. (Jasper Johns offered an elegant demurral, writing “Regrets” on the editor’s invitation to participate in the poll.) But compiling lists can also be a useful parlor game, forcing one to make difficult distinctions and clarify murky values. I admired those with the courage to make a call. Besides, they risked making six friends now—and a thousand enemies forever.What portrait emerges? There is no single look to the art or common countenance to the sensibility of the artists who top the list, each of whom can be viewed in a variety of ways. But there is a powerful shared preoccupation with, to put it as nakedly as possible, “I.” In a period whose presiding spiritual disease is narcissism, the artists we most admire play, seriously, with what we can know about who we think we are. Me, myself, and I—the modern trinity—has rarely seemed less fixed or certain.Of the names near the top, I was first intrigued by Serra and Sherman. It’s no surprise Serra did well. He is the world’s most celebrated living sculptor. But he struck me as somehow different from the others. A declarative artist with a dominating and assertive eye—and “I”—Serra was one of only two respondents in the poll to vote for himself. (The other was the New York-based collective known as Bruce High Quality Foundation.) I would have been disappointed if Serra hadn’t voted for himself. He can be subtle but is no pussyfooter, and his monumental scale, masculine bravura, and capture of the space between the dangerous and the fine seem to recall another, less ironic day than our own. The man who made Tilted Arc and Snake seems close to Jackson Pollock and the boys at the Cedar Bar in the 50s. Before a Serra, I imagine Andy Warhol going, “Wowww,” and Roy Lichtenstein painting Pow!At first glance, Serra might seem an ideal poster boy for a solipsistic age. But his art—on second glance—takes on a very different aspect: It appears steeped in richly disturbing reflections about human scale. Its edgy weight actually offers a dramatic counterpoint to the loose and airy inflations of contemporary culture. Some Serras are overweening and threatening, as if their rusty metal mass might muscle in upon you; some squeeze viewers into a labyrinth. They cut down to size all the little “I”s who busily strut and fret their hour upon the postmodern stage. On the Vanity Fair list no other artist has this bold stance. Instead, most prefer the elusive and filtered, cultivating something conceptual, ironic, and distant. What they share with Serra, however, is an equally uneasy and provocative quality of “I.”Cindy Sherman, at 59, is younger than all of the others in the top six and the only woman (about which more in a moment). If Serra seems all boy, Sherman’s all girl. But, much like Serra, she makes work that puts enormous and sophisticated pressure on our sense of the individual “I.” She’s always playing dress-up, and her art really is about the dress. But not in an old-fashioned way. Sherman portrays a society that can see individuals only through rapidly shuffled forms of stereotype, performance, and disguise. The dress-up is all the more pointed—existentially—when Sherman uses herself as her own model or doll. In her early “Untitled Film Stills,” she did not just copy an actress or celebrity, the way teenagers do; she seemed to capture the soul in a role. (She would understand those tribesmen who, fearing that their souls will be stolen, don’t wish to be photographed.) In her later work she shows more slippage—and wreckage—between mask and model.Both Gerhard Richter and Jasper Johns are highly personal painters, but with selves so seriously slippery that you can find them only in losing them. Richter is a chameleon who, like Sherman taking on a role, can enter into any style of painting and assume its essential character. He can be a calm realist or, if he wants, an explosive Abstract Expressionist. He can be a public painter with political intent or an intimiste fascinated by private detail. Among the many remarkable things about Richter is that, taking his work as a whole, he does not seem to play any easy conceptual game with his shifting styles. He does not diminish any of his approaches by suggesting that he’s engaged in parody or pastiche or dress-up or braggadocio. He contains contraries, as if no single net can capture the whole truth. Richter’s art is so wide that its center is hard to locate, or, more interesting still, not necessarily there.Johns is no less distinctive—and elusive. His painterly hand is typically commented upon and admired. His touch is unusually personal; the brushwork suggests he’s right there with you. Touch itself is often described as the earliest and most essential sensation, our first connection to the world. But Johns is not sentimental about connection. The Johns hand enlivens but does not possess whatever it touches. It never holds down a meaning or thought. A word is not only a word; a flag is not only a flag; a map is not only a map. You are not only you, and I am not only me. In the 1950s, Johns’s American flags turned Stars-and-Stripes certainty into a question. His subsequent work, marinated in personal symbols and iconography, makes a question of himself. Over time, in a culture that can hardly remember yesterday, Johns, at 83, has become the master of the revisited.

A declarative artist with a dominating and assertive eye—and “I”—Serra was one of only two respondents in the poll to vote for himself. (The other was the New York-based collective known as Bruce High Quality Foundation.) I would have been disappointed if Serra hadn’t voted for himself. He can be subtle but is no pussyfooter, and his monumental scale, masculine bravura, and capture of the space between the dangerous and the fine seem to recall another, less ironic day than our own. The man who made Tilted Arc and Snake seems close to Jackson Pollock and the boys at the Cedar Bar in the 50s. Before a Serra, I imagine Andy Warhol going, “Wowww,” and Roy Lichtenstein painting Pow!Tilted ArcSnakeWowww,Pow!At first glance, Serra might seem an ideal poster boy for a solipsistic age. But his art—on second glance—takes on a very different aspect: It appears steeped in richly disturbing reflections about human scale. Its edgy weight actually offers a dramatic counterpoint to the loose and airy inflations of contemporary culture. Some Serras are overweening and threatening, as if their rusty metal mass might muscle in upon you; some squeeze viewers into a labyrinth. They cut down to size all the little “I”s who busily strut and fret their hour upon the postmodern stage. On the Vanity Fair list no other artist has this bold stance. Instead, most prefer the elusive and filtered, cultivating something conceptual, ironic, and distant. What they share with Serra, however, is an equally uneasy and provocative quality of “I.”Cindy Sherman, at 59, is younger than all of the others in the top six and the only woman (about which more in a moment). If Serra seems all boy, Sherman’s all girl. But, much like Serra, she makes work that puts enormous and sophisticated pressure on our sense of the individual “I.” She’s always playing dress-up, and her art really is about the dress. But not in an old-fashioned way. Sherman portrays a society that can see individuals only through rapidly shuffled forms of stereotype, performance, and disguise. The dress-up is all the more pointed—existentially—when Sherman uses herself as her own model or doll. In her early “Untitled Film Stills,” she did not just copy an actress or celebrity, the way teenagers do; she seemed to capture the soul in a role. (She would understand those tribesmen who, fearing that their souls will be stolen, don’t wish to be photographed.) In her later work she shows more slippage—and wreckage—between mask and model.At first glance, Serra might seem an ideal poster boy for a solipsistic age.

Richter is a chameleon who, like Sherman taking on a role, can enter into any style of painting and assume its essential character. He can be a calm realist or, if he wants, an explosive Abstract Expressionist. He can be a public painter with political intent or an intimiste fascinated by private detail. Among the many remarkable things about Richter is that, taking his work as a whole, he does not seem to play any easy conceptual game with his shifting styles. He does not diminish any of his approaches by suggesting that he’s engaged in parody or pastiche or dress-up or braggadocio. He contains contraries, as if no single net can capture the whole truth. Richter’s art is so wide that its center is hard to locate, or, more interesting still, not necessarily there.Johns is no less distinctive—and elusive. His painterly hand is typically commented upon and admired. His touch is unusually personal; the brushwork suggests he’s right there with you. Touch itself is often described as the earliest and most essential sensation, our first connection to the world. But Johns is not sentimental about connection. The Johns hand enlivens but does not possess whatever it touches. It never holds down a meaning or thought. A word is not only a word; a flag is not only a flag; a map is not only a map. You are not only you, and I am not only me. In the 1950s, Johns’s American flags turned Stars-and-Stripes certainty into a question. His subsequent work, marinated in personal symbols and iconography, makes a question of himself. Over time, in a culture that can hardly remember yesterday, Johns, at 83, has become the master of the revisited. He enjoys the momentary touch of memory, but knows it changes even in the remembering.Johns makes puzzles of the self. So do other artists on the list. John Baldessari, who is sometimes called a conceptual artist, is more precisely a conundrum artist. He’s a philosophical joker, blessed with a fine cynicism, slipping joker-like between the playing cards of statements, mediums, and genres and using them together to leave you—leave you what?—hanging on a question. (What Is Painting is a Baldessari painting.) Like Johns and Baldessari, Bruce Nauman, who did particularly well in the vote, also likes to de-stabilize clichés and unsettle the settled self. For many people, Nauman has come to embody, I think, what artistic practice should ideally be in today’s world. He is not confined to any medium, but adapts his methods to his meanings, shifting easily among performance, video, and installations. There is sometimes a nice American deadpan to his work—as in the neon Run from Fear, Fun from Rear—that keeps the solemn, sleepy, and pretentious at bay. And in his more recent art, he has emphasized with visceral power the fragmentary and partial, as if we were now torn and scattered across the landscape.Both Gerhard Richter and Jasper Johns are highly personal painters, but with selves so seriously slippery that you can find them only in losing them.

Historical memory here becomes more menacing and abstract than the personal reveries of Johns; the burden of the past threatens entirely to overwhelm and smother the capital “I.” The dancing silhouettes with which the African-American artist Kara Walker works not only have a historical flavor but also tellingly represent the flattened, partial, and cut-up sensibilities of oppressed people. The figures in the rough-hewn charcoal animations of the South African William Kentridge appear pressed and twisted by invisible historical hands and smudged with guilt. The Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei and the African-American artist David Hammons hurl themselves—often in performance—into their cultures as if to show that the individual can and must confront the historical stereotypes of, say, racism or Communist conformity. But Hammons and Weiwei also attack both the shiny art world and consumer culture for suppressing the individual and imposing stereotypes.There are a few artists in the top 15 who might superficially seem to have little or no interest in narcissism and the uneasy “I.” And yet, one of the main desires today is to escape the solipsistic prison—through, to cite one example, meditation. A wish to escape does not necessarily imply any lack of me-me-me. T. S. Eliot was here first, with his celebrated observation “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.” Ellsworth Kelly’s abstract paintings offer precisely that escape, as do James Turrell’s meditations on light. Brice Marden would never impose on silence. And I would argue that much of the pleasure we derive from Ed Ruscha comes from the way he empties out Pop America, leaving behind something innocent.In a society portrait, who and what has been left off a list—or snubbed, or retired to a distant corner—is no less telling than who occupies the center table.Most surprising to me was how few women received votes. Jeez Louise! In fact, if the two grand Louises were still alive (Bourgeois and Nevelson), they would surely have added to the numbers; the same goes for Joan Mitchell. As it stands, women artists received less than 25 percent of the total number of votes cast; only two women had a place in the top 15. This result comes 50 years after the postwar women’s movement began in earnest in New York, which was the capital of the art world. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised. Last spring, the Robert Miller Gallery staged an old-fashioned panel called “Gender Politics in the Arts,” during which Laurie Simmons, a panelist and a veteran of the New York art world, suddenly veered off topic. Gender? Today, she said, artists talk about nothing but money.At the same time, some big-name and ubiquitous postmoderns, never far from the discussion about contemporary art, fared poorly; perhaps too much love and hate lead, finally, to ho-hum. Damien Hirst, who aspired with his platinum-and-diamond skull to create the symbol of our age, received three votes. Dead meat? Kitsch-meister Jeff Koons received a respectable—respectability can be an affront—five votes. Richard Prince, one vote.Some artists apply enormous historical pressure to the individual self.

Kitsch-meister Jeff Koons received a respectable—respectability can be an affront—five votes. Richard Prince, one vote.Papa Painting showed his age. Nowadays, painting is often not what those of us who love it think of as painting, but just another form of conceptual art. Many art critics do not focus upon this medium anymore, though it can still do well in the marketplace if it is well positioned (or hung). It’s true that Richter, Johns, and Kelly were in the top six, with Brice Marden not too far behind. But you can feel the age and—sorry for this, but sports analogies are required when you talk about lists—there’s not much depth on the bench. After Richter, other much-discussed German painters, such as Anselm Kiefer (3), A. R. Penck (0), and Neo Rauch (1), did not do well. And Robert Ryman was overlooked altogether. Exclude an abstract artist as gifted as Ryman? You can only imagine the situation of more traditional painters. Among those who take seriously what one usually associates with traditional painting, Antonio López García received two votes and David Hockney three. Perhaps painting is now moving to the side, as poetry has, to cultivate its private garden.Frank Stella did not receive a single vote, which is astonishing if one has any institutional memory. In the 1970s, Stella was top fella at the Museum of Modern Art. He was widely regarded as the anointed successor—in the grand, art-historical narrative of progressive modernist painting—of Pollock and Barnett Newman. Some would say the waning of his reputation stems from weakness in his later work, but I disagree. (Many have also grumbled about Johns’s late work, but he did well in the poll.) Stella is a victim of the collapse of confidence in a modernist narrative that emphasizes a this-begat-that progression of style. Had he continued to make the sort of art he made in the 1960s and 1970s, he might now be perceived, as Donald Judd is, as one of the last great moderns in that story. A celebrated period piece. I admire Stella for moving on.What has happened to Stella—cut out from today’s portrait—suggests that you should remain wary of shifting fashions in taste, particularly in a period like ours that does not have powerful convictions about how best to measure art of enduring value. (Imagine if Richter were to strike out in a Vanity Fair poll 30 years from now. Impossible? Well, Stella’s reputation in 1975 was as strong as Richter’s position now.) Another example: some of the reigning artists of the 1980s and 1990s did poorly. There was a time when you could not escape the names of Julian Schnabel (0), David Salle (1), and Francesco Clemente (0). However, if taste is fickle, it also makes sense to prepare for re-appraisals. Perhaps Stella will be a hit at the Museum of Modern Art once again, in 2025.Papa Painting showed his age.

Few people who specialize in photography were asked to vote in the poll, but, even so, the lack of mainstream enthusiasm for photography is noteworthy. (Is photography a woman?) Robert Frank, the Swiss who did so much to define postwar America, did not get one vote. Nor did many talented American photographers who came of age in the later decades of the 20th century. Recently, some Continental photographers have emerged—such as Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth—who deftly capture the strangely warm/cool, vacant, and surreally disconnected character of many postmodern places. They received few votes. Indifference toward performance art is more easily explained, since it’s an idealistic genre that’s not easily seen or collected. (So much in the doing, so little in the done.) But its evanescent spirit, together with its emphasis on the body and role-playing, does offer a brilliant platform from which to address and critique a narcissistic culture. Nauman, Hammons, and Weiwei are social performers, to be sure, but I would have guessed that Marina Abramović—recently the subject of a wildly successful retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art—would have received more than three votes.No doubt many respected artists who received few or no votes would have done better if the voters had been asked to name 10 rather than 6 artists. But establishing a cutoff was the point: it forced voters to define this moment’s priorities. The rather weak showing of artists who can be easily defined—as a “painter,” for example, or a “photographer”—is a defining part of the portrait. (Those artists would have done better in a larger sampling.) What, after all, would you call Nauman, Sherman, or Hammons? What is Weiwei? Or Kentridge? Are Baldessari and Ruscha only painters? Conceptual art doesn’t cover it. The phrase is a meaningless catchall. The preference for artists who are not tied to one genre or another, or who move among genres, reflects an impatience with customary boundaries and scales, perhaps because staying within the lines seems an insufficient response to today’s world. Floaters—and Richter and Johns, despite being painters, have a lot of “float” in their sensibilities—can more easily piece together a postmodern “I” that seems to fit the moment.Several people indicated that they would have liked to vote for artists who died young or who have died recently—but whose work remains a vital part of this moment. They’re right. Certain ghosts are necessary to complete the society portrait. Two in particular. Cy Twombly, whose quixotic line always seems to escape.

Fifty-four of them returned ballots with their choices, which Mark Stevens, the Pulitzer Prize–winning co-author (with his wife, Annalyn Swan) of De Kooning: An American Master, then analyzed. Stevens focused primarily on those with the most votes, remarking both on how few women figured in the top choices and how many honored greats received few or no votes. The final list reveals an astonishing lack of consensus. The 54 people who voted came up with a total of 140 artists. Ten of the 54 voters did not name a single one of the top six artists. Ten more named only one of the top six.PHOTOS The Work of Our Six Greatest Living ArtistsThe New York–based art collective Bruce High Quality Foundation included on its list the Dutch conceptual artist Bas Jan Ader, who, in 1975, was lost at sea and who, like Schrodinger’s cat, is therefore neither dead nor alive. Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami submitted five filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams. Tom Sachs first put down the hip-hop and R&B artists Big Boi and Frank Ocean, then crossed them out and replaced them with Gilbert & George and Sarah Sze.

        "text": "WASIK: I read that one of the reasons you got along really well with artists like Joseph Beuys, Dan Graham, and Lawrence Weiner is that you never needed to say much in one another’s presence. You could just simply understand each other without many words needing to be spoken. Do you believe the same relationship should apply between people and art?GENZKEN: Yes, because in some parts of the world, you get scrutinized for saying the wrong thing about art and in other regions, you get scrutinized for saying nothing at all.WASIK: You met the charming Mr. Beuys a few times when he was alive. Is it true that he once kissed your hand and said, “You are my teacher”?GENZKEN: Yes! One time I even said to him, “Architecture is a catastrophe in Germany; we’ve got to change that,” and he told me, “Go ahead, you can always sign for me if you ever need to.” I’ve never taken him up on the offer, though!WASIK: You once said in an interview, “I want to animate the viewers, hold a mirror up to them.” Why do you believe it’s important to put yourself in the viewer’s shoes and create art that transforms them?GENZKEN: Because it’s exactly this kind of role reversal that I’m interested in, and then it actually makes it a challenge for the viewer. Also, because most artists work in a completely different way. WASIK: You once said, “I think my work is very difficult to understand. Sometimes people do and sometimes they don’t. I can’t do much about that.” Why do you think your art is difficult to understand?GENZKEN: Because “hip-hop” art is simpler and more comprehensible for most people.WASIK: In one of the portraits of yourself at the MoMA exhibition, you are gazing at a photograph of Andy Warhol. Is he an influence of yours?GENZKEN: As a matter of fact, when I showed my “HiFi-Series” to Gerhard Richter in the early ’80s, he bought it and said, “This is better than Andy Warhol.”WASIK: On that note, which artists have inspired or influenced you the most?GENZKEN: The artists who have disappointed me the least.WASIK: The German art world in which you came of age was predominantly male. Did you feel that it was important for you to swim against the tide, so to speak, against artists like Beuys and Richter, to distinguish yourself?GENZKEN: To tell you the truth, it was even more important for me to distinguish myself as being worlds apart from German painter and sculptor Markus Lüpertz.WASIK: You were married for a decade to Gerhard Richter. Did you influence each other artistically? GENZKEN: Yes, throughout our marriage, we influenced each other mutually. We didn’t have a student-teacher kind of relationship.WASIK: Being born in 1948, you grew up in Germany’s post-war boom of the ’50s. How did your upbringing in this postwar landscape influence your art?WASIK: I read that one of the reasons you got along really well with artists like Joseph Beuys, Dan Graham, and Lawrence Weiner is that you never needed to say much in one another’s presence.

Gerhard Richter says somewhere that painting is fine, but it’s music that brings you to your knees. (I wonder if that’s always a good thing.) And I read more literature than I do criticism, history, or theory. I review it sometimes, too. I always wanted to write fiction; I’m just not good at it, and I respect it too much to make a mess of it. Besides, criticism, it should be remembered, was the cutting edge of the culture when I was formed in the 1970s: Who was more vanguard than Susan Sontag and Rosalind Krauss, and more ass-kicking to boot? As for the limits of my own work, I feel them all the time. My prose has little range (Caesar the ape has a bigger vocabulary than I do), and it’s about as supple as that of my Puritan ancestors, but then, like them, I think limits are good. Creative people require the recalcitrance of the medium they work in; its pushing back is what pushes them on. What keeps me going is the interplay between art, criticism, theory, and history; they’re never opposed for me. Art is theoretical in its own way, and theory is artful. Criticism that’s not historically minded sucks, and history that’s not critically spirited is beside the point.RIVKA GALCHEN: You’ve thought and written extensively about the avant-garde’s relation to and resistance to capitalism, about the real, the replica, the readymade, and about the relation of criticism to the instinct to possess.

It has all of the above (resistance to capital, instinct to possess, etc.), plus Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. How not to identify with that guy—his black pullover, his silvery hair, his fake-classy accent? And to have Grace all over you, the Ice Queen melting in your arms, as you get in and out of jams with total aplomb, outfoxing everyone, screwing French bureaucracy along the way. It’s also an allegory of criticism, at least of the deconstructive sort. The best criticism is an inside job. You can’t rely on the authorities; you have to know the enemy better than he knows himself. It takes a thief to apprehend one. Immanent critique is all about going in through a rooftop or a side window, and not nabbing the jewels (who cares about meaning?) but catching the thief (anyone who believes he knows the one true significance).RACHEL KUSHNER: You and I were having an e-mail exchange a while back about the German Romantic notion of integrated civilizations and Lukács.

        "text": "To say that an international artist can be hugely influential in Australia, where their work has rarely been seen​, is to pay testament not just to the aesthetic qualities of their work but also to the appeal of the ideas behind it. German-born Gerhard Richter is one such artist. Since the early 1960s he has explored a number of related themes and ideas, producing paintings and photographs that question the nature of the images that can be produced by both mediums. Through magazines and books, and later the web, Richter’s work has been the subject of intense interest by many Australian artists – even when access to it meant trips to galleries in Europe or the US. Now, the 85-year-old German artist is the subject of a major career survey show, Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images, which opened this weekend at the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane. September (Ed. 139), 2009, print between glass. Photograph: Gerhard Richter With a collection of work that spans Richter’s entire career, and featuring key loans from European, American and Australian collections, this a major coup for the gallery. While the exhibition itself is a standout for both its rigour and range of work, it’s also an opportunity to explore why Richter has had such an influence in Australia.A Facebook friend, who has been involved in art book retailing for more than a decade, posted recently that books about Richter’s work have been hugely popular for many years, and only in the last decade have they been eclipsed by books on perennial favourites Banksy and David Shrigley. On the basis of the pure visual appeal of Richter’s painting, it’s easy to see why. Two candles (499-4), 1982, oil on canvas. Photograph: Gerhard Richter Trained in East Germany in the classical art of realist painting, Richter’s images have the quiet stillness of European masterworks, taking in genres such as the still life, landscape and portraiture, but of contemporary subjects that are often rendered like a slightly out of focus photograph. For Richter this “fuzzy” focus is a way of depicting memory, but it also has an ironic edge since many of Richter’s images are appropriated from the media. Collecting images since the beginning of his career, Richter has compiled thousands of photographs into a vast archive that includes personal and family pictures, all exhibited together under the title Atlas Overview (1962-ongoing). Since the early 1960s, Richter has explored a variety of styles, including various flavours of abstraction, from hard edge stripes to the faux expressionism of squashing paint under glass or dragging it across the canvas with a squeegee. His early works in the 60s, painted from images sourced from the media, were parodies of the then-ascendant international styles of American Pop Art and the postwar culture and economic boom in West Germany at the time. Phantom Interceptors (50), 1964, oil on canvas. Photograph: Gerhard Richter After forming and then promptly disbanding the satirical art movement Capitalist Realism, founded with fellow German artists Sigmar Polke and Konrad Leug, Richter would go on to explore the nature of image making, testing the limits of what might be called a photo, and what might be considered a painting. For Richter, that tactile thingyness of a painting stands in contrast to the ephemeral nature of the photo – particularly the way images appear online, weightless and without material form. He has painted on photos, painted over photos, and questioned the possibility of literally representing monumental tragedy, such as the series Birkenau (2014): four imposing works that had begun life as images of the Nazi death camp of the title, but then painted over to become inscrutable abstracts. This kind of interest in the language and meaning of image making found resonance in Australian art, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, as the dominance of expressionist painting began to wane and a more conceptual, playful and ironic postmodern art emerged. The Popism artists in Melbourne in the mid-1980s – including Maria Kozic, Phillip Brophy and Peter Tyndall, among others – owe no obvious visual allegiance to Richter’s work, but he was conceptually influential, as was his sense of irony. Richter’s continuing influence can be found today in the work of painters who investigate the relationship between the photographic image and painting, and its reproduction in painting, including Halinka Orszulok, Tony Lloyd, Victoria Reichelt and Sam Leach. Earlier this year, the National Gallery of Victoria showed the first comprehensive exhibition of Melbourne-based artist Patrick Pound; titled The Great Exhibition, it was a testament to the influence of Richter’s Atlas Overview on the Australian artist’s work – an influence that Pound himself paid tribute to in his talk at Goma.As an artist, Richter represents a practice of making art that is both remarkably consistent, even within his varying styles, and the result of deep thinking on the implications of making images. Strip (927-9), 2012, digital print on paper between Alu Dibond and Perspex. Photograph: Gerhard Richter One of the lessons of Richter’s work for Australian art is the way in which he has treated history. Along with his Birkenau paintings, one of Richter’s most famous images is the small portrait Uncle Rudi (1965). Dressed in his SS uniform, Uncle Rudi smiles at the viewer amidst a smear of grey and black paint. Made during his Pop period alongside images of clothes dryers, fighter jets and celebrities, there’s a suggestion of an equivalence of moral context in mass media images – the personal and family history at the same level as world historical events. But for a German artist in the postwar period, to acknowledge family participation in the Nazi holocaust is remarkable. For all Richter’s influence here, it’s hard to imagine a white Australian artist acknowledging a family member’s happy participation in the Frontier Wars. Certainly not one smiling so serenely. • Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images is showing at the Gallery of Modern Art (Goma), Brisbane, until 4 February 2018.

Dressed in his SS uniform, Uncle Rudi smiles at the viewer amidst a smear of grey and black paint. Made during his Pop period alongside images of clothes dryers, fighter jets and celebrities, there’s a suggestion of an equivalence of moral context in mass media images – the personal and family history at the same level as world historical events. But for a German artist in the postwar period, to acknowledge family participation in the Nazi holocaust is remarkable. For all Richter’s influence here, it’s hard to imagine a white Australian artist acknowledging a family member’s happy participation in the Frontier Wars. Certainly not one smiling so serenely. • Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images is showing at the Gallery of Modern Art (Goma), Brisbane, until 4 February 2018. Guardian Australia was a guest of GomaTo say that an international artist can be hugely influential in Australia, where their work has rarely been seen​, is to pay testament not just to the aesthetic qualities of their work but also to the appeal of the ideas behind it. German-born Gerhard Richter is one such artist. Since the early 1960s he has explored a number of related themes and ideas, producing paintings and photographs that question the nature of the images that can be produced by both mediums. Through magazines and books, and later the web, Richter’s work has been the subject of intense interest by many Australian artists – even when access to it meant trips to galleries in Europe or the US. Now, the 85-year-old German artist is the subject of a major career survey show, Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images, which opened this weekend at the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane. September (Ed. 139), 2009, print between glass. Photograph: Gerhard Richter With a collection of work that spans Richter’s entire career, and featuring key loans from European, American and Australian collections, this a major coup for the gallery. While the exhibition itself is a standout for both its rigour and range of work, it’s also an opportunity to explore why Richter has had such an influence in Australia.A Facebook friend, who has been involved in art book retailing for more than a decade, posted recently that books about Richter’s work have been hugely popular for many years, and only in the last decade have they been eclipsed by books on perennial favourites Banksy and David Shrigley. On the basis of the pure visual appeal of Richter’s painting, it’s easy to see why. Two candles (499-4), 1982, oil on canvas. Photograph: Gerhard Richter Trained in East Germany in the classical art of realist painting, Richter’s images have the quiet stillness of European masterworks, taking in genres such as the still life, landscape and portraiture, but of contemporary subjects that are often rendered like a slightly out of focus photograph. For Richter this “fuzzy” focus is a way of depicting memory, but it also has an ironic edge since many of Richter’s images are appropriated from the media. Collecting images since the beginning of his career, Richter has compiled thousands of photographs into a vast archive that includes personal and family pictures, all exhibited together under the title Atlas Overview (1962-ongoing). Since the early 1960s, Richter has explored a variety of styles, including various flavours of abstraction, from hard edge stripes to the faux expressionism of squashing paint under glass or dragging it across the canvas with a squeegee. His early works in the 60s, painted from images sourced from the media, were parodies of the then-ascendant international styles of American Pop Art and the postwar culture and economic boom in West Germany at the time. Phantom Interceptors (50), 1964, oil on canvas. Photograph: Gerhard Richter After forming and then promptly disbanding the satirical art movement Capitalist Realism, founded with fellow German artists Sigmar Polke and Konrad Leug, Richter would go on to explore the nature of image making, testing the limits of what might be called a photo, and what might be considered a painting. For Richter, that tactile thingyness of a painting stands in contrast to the ephemeral nature of the photo – particularly the way images appear online, weightless and without material form. He has painted on photos, painted over photos, and questioned the possibility of literally representing monumental tragedy, such as the series Birkenau (2014): four imposing works that had begun life as images of the Nazi death camp of the title, but then painted over to become inscrutable abstracts. This kind of interest in the language and meaning of image making found resonance in Australian art, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, as the dominance of expressionist painting began to wane and a more conceptual, playful and ironic postmodern art emerged. The Popism artists in Melbourne in the mid-1980s – including Maria Kozic, Phillip Brophy and Peter Tyndall, among others – owe no obvious visual allegiance to Richter’s work, but he was conceptually influential, as was his sense of irony. Richter’s continuing influence can be found today in the work of painters who investigate the relationship between the photographic image and painting, and its reproduction in painting, including Halinka Orszulok, Tony Lloyd, Victoria Reichelt and Sam Leach. Earlier this year, the National Gallery of Victoria showed the first comprehensive exhibition of Melbourne-based artist Patrick Pound; titled The Great Exhibition, it was a testament to the influence of Richter’s Atlas Overview on the Australian artist’s work – an influence that Pound himself paid tribute to in his talk at Goma.As an artist, Richter represents a practice of making art that is both remarkably consistent, even within his varying styles, and the result of deep thinking on the implications of making images.

        "text": "Richter's September (2009). (Photo: Courtesy of the artist and Marian Goodman Gallery, New York/Paris) Decades ago, Gerhard Richter found a painterly philosopher’s stone. Like Jackson Pollock before him, he discovered something that had been in painting all along, always overlooked or discounted. Just as Pollock used the drip to meld process and product, Richter “found” and used the smudge and the blur to ravish the eye, creating works of psychic and physical power. Seen together in his current Marian Goodman show, a series of incandescently alabaster near-monochrome paintings are among the most majestic, haunting, voluptuous, and vulnerable of his career. (This despite the deathly coldness and once-removed manner at which Richter reigns supreme.) Richter’s system—skids and overlays of contrasting color, wet-on-wet paint that looks pulled with a squeegee—is so complex, supple, and subtle that it’s all but impossible to figure out how his art is made. He observes his process as much as he controls it, adding inscrutability, surprise, strangeness, and awe to his work. His marbled sweeps and sluices of high-key color, his clashing dissolves and blends of flecked, blazing paint, his erasure of spatial demarcations, and his radiance make him the most purely optical postwar artist since Dan Flavin, and one of the greatest painters alive.In the new show, the room immediately off the elevator almost brought me to my knees. Four large, glowing horizontal canvases envelop and surround you. Each is so physical as to be almost architectural. The color is like streaked aluminum, billowy sheets of smoke, and iridescent clouds. For decades Richter has numbered his works, and these paintings are part of series No. 911. It’s no coincidence: A small print depicts two tall silvery shapes with streaks going into them as smoke flows above. It’s titled September. The paintings become an abstract conjuration, and commemoration of an indelible moment.Richter is a complex character. He’s emphatically empirical—“I have always loathed subjectivity”—and has said that all ideologies “are superfluous and mortally dangerous.” He might cringe at this interpretation, but his 911 paintings are abstract, unsentimental evocations of the annihilation that can come from ideology.

        "text": "Gerhard Richter, the world-famous German painter, has expressed his incredulity at the astronomical sums paid for his works, calling the art market “hopelessly excessive” and saying that prices are rarely a reflection on quality.Richter, 83, told the German daily Die Zeit he had watched the outcome of a recent auction at Sotheby’s in London with horror after an anonymous buyer paid £30.4m (€41m, $46.5m) for his 1986 oil-on-canvas, Abstraktes Bild. We artists get next to nothing from such an auction. Except for a small morsel, all the profit goes to the seller “The records keep being broken and every time my initial reaction is one of horror even if it’s actually welcome news. But there is something really shocking about the amount,” Richter said.He said he believed people who paid so much money for his paintings were foolish and foresaw that prices for his art would crash “when the art market corrects itself”, as he was convinced it would.Seen as the leader of the New European Painting movement which emerged in the second half of the 20th century, Richter made a name for himself with “photo-paintings” that replicate photographs and are then “blurred” with a squeegee or a brush.The price paid for Abstraktes Bild amounted to a staggering 5,000-fold increase on the price he had originally sold it for, he said.He told the weekly newspaper that he understood as much about the art market as he did “about Chinese or physics”, and said contrary to a common perception he hardly benefited at all from such sales.“We artists get next to nothing from such an auction. Except for a small morsel, all the profit goes to the seller,” he said. Gerhard Richter in front of one of his paintings at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in June 2012. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images Richter said he was given the impression by gallery owners that he was inclined to undervalue his own work. Recently, having set the price of one of his photographs at €2,000, he said he was told by a gallery owner: “You can’t sell that for €2,000, it needs to be more like €10,000 or €20,000.”He was relieved, he said, that he did not have much to do with the buying and selling process. “Luckily I can … shut my studio door on most of the discussion about the market and prices. I’m good at suppressing it,” he added.He said that while it had been years since he had seen Abstraktes Bild – created by his trademark technique of building up paint and then pulling it away with a piece of wood – he remembered it being a “quite good” piece of art, in contrast to his painting Domplatz, Mailand (Cathedral Square, Milan) which last year fetched €29m at auction.“I found that odd,” he said. “I don’t think the picture is that great … when I heard what it had gone for at auction, I thought ‘that’s completely over the top’.”Richter, who was born in Dresden, said he was nonplussed as to how and why auctions had become so important. “It is really quite alarming, particularly when you take a look at the catalogues. They always send them to me and they get worse and worse. You cannot imagine what rubbish is offered, at prices that are rising all the time,” he said. He said that both “serious galleries” and young artists were suffering as a result.“Many of the young artists go straight to auctions in order to earn the big bucks. So in contrast to the past artists cannot develop slowly. And the business is getting more anonymous. In the end it just comes down to the price.”Richter fondly recalled the memory of selling Abstraktes Bild almost 30 years ago to a Cologne collector “for I think around 15,000 marks” (around €7,670). “I was very proud that it became part of his collection.” No one who had bought his works in recent years, he said, had ever contacted him to show an interest in him or his work, implying that they were only interested in the work’s investment value. He confirmed that often his works were among those bought as safe, tax-free capital investments and stored in art bunkers in east Asia or Switzerland.Richter said he had resigned himself to the fact that “hardly any one talks about art any more. Even in the arts pages of the broadsheets”.He said he was virtually powerless to alter the prices of his works. Attempting to torpedo the high prices by offering new works at lower prices only backfired, he said. “I made 100 small original paintings and sold them very cheaply. They sold immediately and promptly ended up being sold at auction … you cannot escape the market.”Richter said that an original work of art had barely any meaning for him and he had many reproductions hanging in his studio.He praised an initiative offered at Tate Modern in London where he had an exhibition in 2011, in which his works were run off on a printer. “I found it terrific … they had an online printer that printed off loads of my pictures so that everyone could take one home with them.”He admitted he never buys art himself. “I don’t spend money on art,” he said. “I like looking at paintings, but I go to a museum to do so. I don’t have to own art myself.”Gerhard Richter, the world-famous German painter, has expressed his incredulity at the astronomical sums paid for his works, calling the art market “hopelessly excessive” and saying that prices are rarely a reflection on quality.Richter, 83, told the German daily Die Zeit he had watched the outcome of a recent auction at Sotheby’s in London with horror after an anonymous buyer paid £30.4m (€41m, $46.5m) for his 1986 oil-on-canvas, Abstraktes Bild.

So in contrast to the past artists cannot develop slowly. And the business is getting more anonymous. In the end it just comes down to the price.”Richter fondly recalled the memory of selling Abstraktes Bild almost 30 years ago to a Cologne collector “for I think around 15,000 marks” (around €7,670). “I was very proud that it became part of his collection.” No one who had bought his works in recent years, he said, had ever contacted him to show an interest in him or his work, implying that they were only interested in the work’s investment value. He confirmed that often his works were among those bought as safe, tax-free capital investments and stored in art bunkers in east Asia or Switzerland.Richter said he had resigned himself to the fact that “hardly any one talks about art any more. Even in the arts pages of the broadsheets”.He said he was virtually powerless to alter the prices of his works. Attempting to torpedo the high prices by offering new works at lower prices only backfired, he said. “I made 100 small original paintings and sold them very cheaply. They sold immediately and promptly ended up being sold at auction … you cannot escape the market.”Richter said that an original work of art had barely any meaning for him and he had many reproductions hanging in his studio.He praised an initiative offered at Tate Modern in London where he had an exhibition in 2011, in which his works were run off on a printer. “I found it terrific … they had an online printer that printed off loads of my pictures so that everyone could take one home with them.”He admitted he never buys art himself. “I don’t spend money on art,” he said. “I like looking at paintings, but I go to a museum to do so. I don’t have to own art myself.”Gerhard Richter, the world-famous German painter, has expressed his incredulity at the astronomical sums paid for his works, calling the art market “hopelessly excessive” and saying that prices are rarely a reflection on quality.Richter, 83, told the German daily Die Zeit he had watched the outcome of a recent auction at Sotheby’s in London with horror after an anonymous buyer paid £30.4m (€41m, $46.5m) for his 1986 oil-on-canvas, Abstraktes Bild. We artists get next to nothing from such an auction. Except for a small morsel, all the profit goes to the seller “The records keep being broken and every time my initial reaction is one of horror even if it’s actually welcome news. But there is something really shocking about the amount,” Richter said.He said he believed people who paid so much money for his paintings were foolish and foresaw that prices for his art would crash “when the art market corrects itself”, as he was convinced it would.Seen as the leader of the New European Painting movement which emerged in the second half of the 20th century, Richter made a name for himself with “photo-paintings” that replicate photographs and are then “blurred” with a squeegee or a brush.The price paid for Abstraktes Bild amounted to a staggering 5,000-fold increase on the price he had originally sold it for, he said.He told the weekly newspaper that he understood as much about the art market as he did “about Chinese or physics”, and said contrary to a common perception he hardly benefited at all from such sales.“We artists get next to nothing from such an auction. Except for a small morsel, all the profit goes to the seller,” he said. Gerhard Richter in front of one of his paintings at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in June 2012. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images Richter said he was given the impression by gallery owners that he was inclined to undervalue his own work. Recently, having set the price of one of his photographs at €2,000, he said he was told by a gallery owner: “You can’t sell that for €2,000, it needs to be more like €10,000 or €20,000.”He was relieved, he said, that he did not have much to do with the buying and selling process. “Luckily I can … shut my studio door on most of the discussion about the market and prices. I’m good at suppressing it,” he added.He said that while it had been years since he had seen Abstraktes Bild – created by his trademark technique of building up paint and then pulling it away with a piece of wood – he remembered it being a “quite good” piece of art, in contrast to his painting Domplatz, Mailand (Cathedral Square, Milan) which last year fetched €29m at auction.“I found that odd,” he said. “I don’t think the picture is that great … when I heard what it had gone for at auction, I thought ‘that’s completely over the top’.”Richter, who was born in Dresden, said he was nonplussed as to how and why auctions had become so important. “It is really quite alarming, particularly when you take a look at the catalogues. They always send them to me and they get worse and worse. You cannot imagine what rubbish is offered, at prices that are rising all the time,” he said.

        "text": "Undoubtedly the “most expensive” superlative contributes to the mainstream attention. Mr. Richter has lately commanded prices at auction that are extraordinarily high for a living artist, selling one abstract painting at Sotheby’s in November for $20.8 million. He has repeatedly called the sums his works fetch “absurd,” but that has only added to the attention.Mr. Richter’s biography reads as though tailor made to fit Germany’s 20th-century historical narrative. Born in Dresden in 1932, one year before Hitler took power, he left East Germany for the West in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall went up, and never saw his parents again.But his superstardom here does not stem just from a resonant back story. The retrospective, which runs through May 13, shows off his versatility, as well as his ample talent and ambition, in haunting portraits and paintings of orderly blocks of color facing enormous abstract canvases slathered with layer upon layer of paint. And his paintings of photographs, once questioned by purists, now seem to have prefigured a Tumblr and Facebook era in which finding, posting and recycling images are an everyday activity.“Everyone is in an archival roller-coaster process of picture language,” said the photographer Thomas Struth, who studied under Mr. Richter in the 1970s. “That almost seems to have been embedded in Gerhard’s work, as if he had foreseen the process which was going to happen 40 years later.”In addition to the retrospective at the Neue Nationalgalerie (or New National Gallery) those interested in Mr. Richter’s source material can travel to a museum in Dresden to view his “Atlas,” a compilation, decades in the making, of more than 8,000 sketches, clippings and photographs used to create his works, a monumental archive as exhibition. Back in Berlin a private collection, the me Collectors Room Berlin, is exhibiting the complete collection of Mr. Richter’s prints and editions of photographs.There will be a lecture series here and weekly screenings of the 2011 documentary “Gerhard Richter Painting,” an understated film with long scenes of the artist at work on abstract canvases.“He’s being treated like a German hero; he has a stand-alone position right now,” said Holger Liebs, editor in chief of Monopol, a leading German art magazine. This month Monopol ran an article about a year in Mr. Richter’s life and a series of previously unpublished photographic self-portraits from 1966, including cover images of his face frozen in contortions with strips of tape.Mr. Liebs pointed to a 2002 Richter retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art as a turning point not only in Mr. Richter’s reception in the United States but also in how he was perceived at home. “When Germans leave the country and get recognition elsewhere, everyone loves them even more here,” Mr. Liebs said.The Modern acquired Mr. Richter’s controversial cycle of paintings inspired by the suicides of members of the left-wing terrorist group the Red Army Faction. The series of 15 somber, gray atmospheric canvases, known as “October 18, 1977” for the day their bodies were discovered, had evoked strong, often critical reactions in Germany.When the current retrospective opened last year in its first incarnation, at the Tate Modern in London, the paintings from that cycle were part of the show. In Berlin they are displayed separately in the Alte Nationalgalerie, in a room that “normally houses works from the era of German Romanticism, works infused with patriotism after the victory over Napoleon in 1815,” according to the exhibition text.There the pictures, the text says, “can clearly be seen in the art-historical context of history painting.” These paintings still move Germans, but no longer prompt the kind of impassioned discussion they once did.“Most people who become really very good are very self-critical about themselves,” Mr. Struth said. “To receive only this positive reaction, it’s painful. You think, ‘O.K., that’s great, but what did I do wrong?’ ” He added, “Gerhard, rightly so, almost complains that everyone loves his work, which is kind of an odd feeling, but people are fascinated by celebrity, fame and money, which has very little to do with what the work is about.”Hundreds of journalists gathered for the news conference that opened the retrospective last week. Udo Kittelmann, director of the National Galleries, implored them not to ask Mr. Richter about the prices paid for his canvases. “It has no more novelty value, and Mr. Richter surely has more to say about his pictures than what they cost,” Mr. Kittelmann said.A reporter asked Mr. Richter how it felt to be “celebrated at the moment like no other artist has ever experienced,” as a “titan, an Olympian.” Mr. Richter smiled slyly and replied, “Being ignored would certainly be a lot worse.”Continue reading the main storyUndoubtedly the “most expensive” superlative contributes to the mainstream attention.

Back in Berlin a private collection, the me Collectors Room Berlin, is exhibiting the complete collection of Mr. Richter’s prints and editions of photographs.There will be a lecture series here and weekly screenings of the 2011 documentary “Gerhard Richter Painting,” an understated film with long scenes of the artist at work on abstract canvases.“He’s being treated like a German hero; he has a stand-alone position right now,” said Holger Liebs, editor in chief of Monopol, a leading German art magazine. This month Monopol ran an article about a year in Mr. Richter’s life and a series of previously unpublished photographic self-portraits from 1966, including cover images of his face frozen in contortions with strips of tape.Mr. Liebs pointed to a 2002 Richter retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art as a turning point not only in Mr. Richter’s reception in the United States but also in how he was perceived at home. “When Germans leave the country and get recognition elsewhere, everyone loves them even more here,” Mr. Liebs said.The Modern acquired Mr. Richter’s controversial cycle of paintings inspired by the suicides of members of the left-wing terrorist group the Red Army Faction. The series of 15 somber, gray atmospheric canvases, known as “October 18, 1977” for the day their bodies were discovered, had evoked strong, often critical reactions in Germany.When the current retrospective opened last year in its first incarnation, at the Tate Modern in London, the paintings from that cycle were part of the show. In Berlin they are displayed separately in the Alte Nationalgalerie, in a room that “normally houses works from the era of German Romanticism, works infused with patriotism after the victory over Napoleon in 1815,” according to the exhibition text.There the pictures, the text says, “can clearly be seen in the art-historical context of history painting.” These paintings still move Germans, but no longer prompt the kind of impassioned discussion they once did.“Most people who become really very good are very self-critical about themselves,” Mr. Struth said. “To receive only this positive reaction, it’s painful. You think, ‘O.K., that’s great, but what did I do wrong?’ ” He added, “Gerhard, rightly so, almost complains that everyone loves his work, which is kind of an odd feeling, but people are fascinated by celebrity, fame and money, which has very little to do with what the work is about.”Hundreds of journalists gathered for the news conference that opened the retrospective last week. Udo Kittelmann, director of the National Galleries, implored them not to ask Mr. Richter about the prices paid for his canvases. “It has no more novelty value, and Mr. Richter surely has more to say about his pictures than what they cost,” Mr. Kittelmann said.A reporter asked Mr. Richter how it felt to be “celebrated at the moment like no other artist has ever experienced,” as a “titan, an Olympian.” Mr. Richter smiled slyly and replied, “Being ignored would certainly be a lot worse.”Continue reading the main story"

        "text": "Tate Modern's tremendous survey of the German master Gerhard Richter opens with a painting of second world war bombers shedding their ordnance from that other world above the clouds. It is clearly based on a photograph. The planes are as small as children's toys, the bombs no more than tiny hyphens falling weightlessly through the sky and one barely notices the dark speck dropping far below: a hit plane, a pilot crashing to his death.The painting delivers this horror with a softly blurred touch. The planes are as spectral as ghosts, the Flying Fortress markings indistinct in the silver-gray paint. The atmosphere is something like a silent movie, or a dream, so that one has to pay close attention – even as the picture pulls in the opposite direction – to deduce that the original photograph must have been taken from a US bomber like the one that is plunging down towards the doomed Germans below. Death is elsewhere. The painting asks you to think for yourself.It is possible that Richter himself heard these planes. Born in Dresden in 1932, he survived the allied bombings and eventually crossed to the west in 1961. Although his paintings partake of the cool, mechanical exactitude of the photographs they transcribe in various ways, they are characterised by scepticism, distance and doubt. One might say that the painter rarely fails to see both sides.This variety is considerable, from the distinctive photo-paintings with their supersmooth blur that have made him the world's most revered (and expensive) living painter, to the miasmic grey abstracts, \"like photographs of nothing\"; from the outsize colour charts to the colossal magnifications of his own brushstrokes – always derived from photographs. But by far the most distinctive is the famous blur, where the image is brushed across in delicate sweeps or dissolves into an almost imperceptible sfumato, taking the image with it – distanced, ungraspable, lost to the past or beyond us.Tate Modern is showing 50 years of work, from the early black-and-white history paintings to the rapturous still lifes of today. One sees as never before that this blur is always different, and always material to the picture's content. The face famous from a zillion paparazzi shots dwindles to nothing in a gray shimmer; the long dead are retrieved from oblivion in cobweb-fine paint. Everything carries a metaphor.One of the dead is Richter's Aunt Marianne, young, blond, smiling as she props her baby nephew Gerhard on a pillow. She is smoothed, soothed, by gentle lateral brushstrokes which blend the two figures – his soft hair with her sweet face – as if to unite them once more.Marianne was sterilised and later murdered by the Nazis.The image, taken from a family album, is out of focus, something like a memory one cannot quite summon through the veils of time and consciousness. Its obverse is the controversial painting of Uncle Rudi, grinning proudly in his SS uniform (a painting Richter donated to the war memorial at Lidice in the Czech Republic). Here the brush blends Rudi with the wall behind him in horizontal striations evocative of barbed wire; repressed memory given a face.The artist once said that all paintings are analogies, not just representations, and the wisdom of this truth is made apparent throughout the show. One sees it in the images based on photographs of bombed cities, heaps of rubble that are all but illegible to the eye, a disintegration re-enacted in the paintings themselves. At a distance quite figurative, they fall apart as you approach into areas of total incoherence.And one even sees it in the all-grey abstracts of the 70s, so implacably neutral, made at a time when Richter had almost lost faith in his painting altogether. But he continued, working the surfaces with tiny incidents so that one cannot completely turn away.Because he is such a virtuoso painter, as well as monastically reserved – the self-portraits are almost completely effaced – Richter's art has always seemed to arrive out of mystery. What is he thinking, what does he feel about his subjects: every painting trails a question. What are his skull pictures: memento mori or soft kitsch? What are his candles, so blurred and yet bright: votive or secular? At face value, they are simply irreducibly beautiful.There are paintings here that approach the dead end of art: huge enlargements of brushstrokes prophylactically sealed behind surfaces flawless as laminate; the squeegee paintings which repudiate all idea of expressive touch; close-up photographs of oil paint transcribed in oil paint. The strict chronology of the show (and its desire to present Richter whole) admits too many such works.But they lead one insistently back, I suppose, to the question of interpretation and this turns out to be less about Richter's use of photographs – images at one remove – than the selection of those images itself.The choice becomes, in part, the subject of the painting: Uncle Rudi, Aunt Marianne, his family and friends, the heroes of culture, the villains of war, his wife nursing their baby; these are not meaningless or trivial. And what is, and will surely remain, the most inflammatory of all Richter's works – the 15 Baader-Meinhof paintings – must be understood at the very least as an attention to controversial history.The arrests of the gang members, the police photographs, the televised funeral with its horizontal interference patterns: each image is on the verge of indeterminacy. The painting of Andreas Baader's book-lined cell is the visual equivalent of a shudder, top to bottom; the body of Gudrun Ensslin, rope marks round her neck, tells one nothing about her death (suicide or murder?). Eye and understanding are equally baffled and thwarted.But notice the portrait of Ensslin as a child pensively slipped in among them.Equivocal restraint is Richter's great characteristic, his principle, the moral of his approach. But something alters, or distils, when he paints from photographs he has taken himself. He snaps his daughter reading a letter, meditative in the sunshine, and she becomes a Vermeer. He photographs the German landscape and you plunge deep into its painted richness; a vase of yellow tulips fairly burns with joy.But for sheer unqualified beauty, go to the last room of this show with its garlands and snowscapes and transcendent abstractions, white on white on light. Richter, at almost 80, is passionately drawn to the experiences of the eye and the light that makes everything visible. If these paintings are analogies of anything specific, it is our human love of looking at the world.The final painting in the room, superbly curated, shows the end of life. It is not immediately obvious that somewhere among the brilliant blue of the painting, and the sky on that day, are the Twin Towers as the aeroplanes hit. That blue is besmirched, dragged back and forth with gray so that one can hardly see what is there before one's eyes. It is a stupendous painting: incomprehensible, disintegrating, vanishing into itself.

Its obverse is the controversial painting of Uncle Rudi, grinning proudly in his SS uniform (a painting Richter donated to the war memorial at Lidice in the Czech Republic). Here the brush blends Rudi with the wall behind him in horizontal striations evocative of barbed wire; repressed memory given a face.The artist once said that all paintings are analogies, not just representations, and the wisdom of this truth is made apparent throughout the show. One sees it in the images based on photographs of bombed cities, heaps of rubble that are all but illegible to the eye, a disintegration re-enacted in the paintings themselves. At a distance quite figurative, they fall apart as you approach into areas of total incoherence.And one even sees it in the all-grey abstracts of the 70s, so implacably neutral, made at a time when Richter had almost lost faith in his painting altogether. But he continued, working the surfaces with tiny incidents so that one cannot completely turn away.Because he is such a virtuoso painter, as well as monastically reserved – the self-portraits are almost completely effaced – Richter's art has always seemed to arrive out of mystery. What is he thinking, what does he feel about his subjects: every painting trails a question. What are his skull pictures: memento mori or soft kitsch? What are his candles, so blurred and yet bright: votive or secular? At face value, they are simply irreducibly beautiful.There are paintings here that approach the dead end of art: huge enlargements of brushstrokes prophylactically sealed behind surfaces flawless as laminate; the squeegee paintings which repudiate all idea of expressive touch; close-up photographs of oil paint transcribed in oil paint. The strict chronology of the show (and its desire to present Richter whole) admits too many such works.But they lead one insistently back, I suppose, to the question of interpretation and this turns out to be less about Richter's use of photographs – images at one remove – than the selection of those images itself.The choice becomes, in part, the subject of the painting: Uncle Rudi, Aunt Marianne, his family and friends, the heroes of culture, the villains of war, his wife nursing their baby; these are not meaningless or trivial. And what is, and will surely remain, the most inflammatory of all Richter's works – the 15 Baader-Meinhof paintings – must be understood at the very least as an attention to controversial history.The arrests of the gang members, the police photographs, the televised funeral with its horizontal interference patterns: each image is on the verge of indeterminacy. The painting of Andreas Baader's book-lined cell is the visual equivalent of a shudder, top to bottom; the body of Gudrun Ensslin, rope marks round her neck, tells one nothing about her death (suicide or murder?). Eye and understanding are equally baffled and thwarted.But notice the portrait of Ensslin as a child pensively slipped in among them.Equivocal restraint is Richter's great characteristic, his principle, the moral of his approach. But something alters, or distils, when he paints from photographs he has taken himself. He snaps his daughter reading a letter, meditative in the sunshine, and she becomes a Vermeer. He photographs the German landscape and you plunge deep into its painted richness; a vase of yellow tulips fairly burns with joy.But for sheer unqualified beauty, go to the last room of this show with its garlands and snowscapes and transcendent abstractions, white on white on light. Richter, at almost 80, is passionately drawn to the experiences of the eye and the light that makes everything visible. If these paintings are analogies of anything specific, it is our human love of looking at the world.The final painting in the room, superbly curated, shows the end of life. It is not immediately obvious that somewhere among the brilliant blue of the painting, and the sky on that day, are the Twin Towers as the aeroplanes hit. That blue is besmirched, dragged back and forth with gray so that one can hardly see what is there before one's eyes. It is a stupendous painting: incomprehensible, disintegrating, vanishing into itself. And it is the very thing one has been waiting for all along – the show's bared heart."

        "text": "Marian Goodman Gallery24 West 57th Street, ManhattanThrough Oct. 27Gerhard Richter's latest New York gallery exhibition feels like a cross between a new-car showroom and a tutorial in postmodern painting. The show is full of undeniably handsome new Richters, 38 in all, hot off the assembly line. Their arrangement, which fills four galleries, rehearses the artist's famous disdain for distinctions between abstraction and representation, industrial production and artistic touch. Once again his signature all-over horizontal blur is much in evidence, blending intent and accident and creating a sheen of bravura, although this time the blur tends to be a silvery, penitential gray.As usual, these works reflect an artist who approaches painting as an elaborate and fascinating game, like chess, and seems to move effortlessly in several directions at once. He borrows from other art, say Chinese painting, and as always from photography, basing works on snapshots while suggesting that making a painting can be almost as mechanical as snapping a shutter. He circles back to quote himself: the silvery gray recalls the more leaden grays that dominated his early work. Frequently he finishes a work with a few brusque graffiti-like lines ridiculing Expressionism or expression yet somehow signaling a deep commitment to painting.In each gallery a representational painting or two interrupt the flow of abstract works. In the first room, a small blurred image of bare trees holds its own against 11 large silvery abstractions, inviting us to read some of them as landscapes, which often is not hard. Next door an out-of-focus view of a country lane, all greens and yellows, hangs beside a watery also out-of-focus abstraction whose title suggests Chinese art as inspiration.Down the hall, two small paintings based on snapshots of the artist's infant son, Moritz, hang side by side, suggesting details from a Dutch genre scene; one is complete, the other unfinished and smeared or defaced. And in the show's final small gallery, where the grays finally yield unequivocally to warmer browns, four abstractions are color-coordinated with a fuzzy double portrait, based on a snapshot of the artist and another man in front of a church.Mr. Richter is a great and practiced artist, and as usual he puts on a good show. It doesn't reveal anything we don't already know about his painting and often suggests that movement in all directions has become the best disguise for flailing. But the new Richters assure us that the product is still reliable, especially if one takes quantity as the ultimate confirmation of quality, and that the artist will continue to smile, if not exactly laugh, all the way to the bank.

        "text": "Renowned for the conceptual and philosophical messages underlying his photographs, the ­Tokyo-born artist Hiroshi Sugimoto has spent years amassing a curio cabinet of artifacts—from mummified cats and 18th-century prints of a hermaphrodite’s sexual organs to space-age debris, including a fragment of the parachute worn by the first female cosmonaut. He’d long wanted a place to display these for visitors and to contemplate them himself. “I’m often invited to see the homes of famous collectors,” Sugimoto told me, “and you’ll have a gorgeous Fifth Avenue apartment with huge space, but it’s usually full of so much art crammed on the walls, even on the staircases—and to me this is very uncomfortable. The artworks are killing each other. I always thought, Well, this is the American way of showing. It’s very bad taste.”A teahouse, he decided, would make the perfect setting for his own collection, a place where he could switch out the work on view depending on the guest—­a variation on a Japanese tea-ceremony ­tradition, which calls for the decor to be planned specifically for each visitor, much in the way a menu might be. “By doing so, you pay more attention to your guest,” he said. “I think that’s a more sophisticated way of presenting art.”In 2009, the demise of a Chelsea gallery gave Sugimoto his chance. After acquiring the space, which sits atop his studio, he spent a year designing it, obsessing over such materials as bamboo and tree bark. He stripped 20 layers of paint from the concrete walls, whose unfinished patina now reminds him of both a ninth-century Japanese temple and the work of Gerhard Richter. He also created a tiled walkway banked by mosses to evoke a Japanese garden.In his photographs, Sugimoto doesn’t capture specific moments, preferring to see time as more fluid. In an iconic series showing the interiors of American movie palaces, for example, the film is exposed for the duration of the movie being shown. Time’s passing is also recorded in his by-invitation-only teahouse. He pointed out a Duchampian ready-made clock he assembled from bits of glass and metal­—“Duchamp is my trauma. He’s always in my head,” he said—as well as fossils he had placed, just so, in a hole in the entryway ceiling.Of course, it’s precisely this fusion of past and present that the 63-year-old Sugimoto savors: Not only will he show, say, a meteorite next to the Rembrandt print he remounted on a Japanese scroll, but his close friend, the Kyoto tea master Sen ­So-oku, 35—a direct descendant of the founder of the 16th-century Japanese tea ceremony—will preside over the inaugural ceremonies on October 29. The opening will coincide with ­Sugimoto’s latest exhibition of crystal pagodas and aluminum sculptures at the Pace Gallery in Chelsea.“It’s like a place to escape,” he said. He was looking out the window of his teahouse, which is notable for both its surreal tranquility amid the urbanity outside and the views it affords of the Hudson River, two enormous water towers, and the rising One World Trade Center. For those who are able to kneel with their back straight, there is a room of tatami mats, but Sugimoto has also designed a table for 10 out of thousand-year-old Canadian cedar, the base of which is made of the optical glass used in camera lenses. Still, for all of Sugi­moto’s attention to tradition, tea is not the only tonic to be served in the house. “We can definitely have champagne parties here,” he said cheerfully. “Of course, if I take all my time to do this, then I will have no time to make art.”© Hiroshi Sugimoto, Courtesy of The Pace GalleryRenowned for the conceptual and philosophical messages underlying his photographs, the ­Tokyo-born artist Hiroshi Sugimoto has spent years amassing a curio cabinet of artifacts—from mummified cats and 18th-century prints of a hermaphrodite’s sexual organs to space-age debris, including a fragment of the parachute worn by the first female cosmonaut.

For those who are able to kneel with their back straight, there is a room of tatami mats, but Sugimoto has also designed a table for 10 out of thousand-year-old Canadian cedar, the base of which is made of the optical glass used in camera lenses. Still, for all of Sugi­moto’s attention to tradition, tea is not the only tonic to be served in the house. “We can definitely have champagne parties here,” he said cheerfully. “Of course, if I take all my time to do this, then I will have no time to make art.”© Hiroshi Sugimoto, Courtesy of The Pace GalleryRenowned for the conceptual and philosophical messages underlying his photographs, the ­Tokyo-born artist Hiroshi Sugimoto has spent years amassing a curio cabinet of artifacts—from mummified cats and 18th-century prints of a hermaphrodite’s sexual organs to space-age debris, including a fragment of the parachute worn by the first female cosmonaut. He’d long wanted a place to display these for visitors and to contemplate them himself. “I’m often invited to see the homes of famous collectors,” Sugimoto told me, “and you’ll have a gorgeous Fifth Avenue apartment with huge space, but it’s usually full of so much art crammed on the walls, even on the staircases—and to me this is very uncomfortable. The artworks are killing each other. I always thought, Well, this is the American way of showing. It’s very bad taste.”A teahouse, he decided, would make the perfect setting for his own collection, a place where he could switch out the work on view depending on the guest—­a variation on a Japanese tea-ceremony ­tradition, which calls for the decor to be planned specifically for each visitor, much in the way a menu might be. “By doing so, you pay more attention to your guest,” he said. “I think that’s a more sophisticated way of presenting art.”In 2009, the demise of a Chelsea gallery gave Sugimoto his chance. After acquiring the space, which sits atop his studio, he spent a year designing it, obsessing over such materials as bamboo and tree bark. He stripped 20 layers of paint from the concrete walls, whose unfinished patina now reminds him of both a ninth-century Japanese temple and the work of Gerhard Richter. He also created a tiled walkway banked by mosses to evoke a Japanese garden.In his photographs, Sugimoto doesn’t capture specific moments, preferring to see time as more fluid. In an iconic series showing the interiors of American movie palaces, for example, the film is exposed for the duration of the movie being shown. Time’s passing is also recorded in his by-invitation-only teahouse. He pointed out a Duchampian ready-made clock he assembled from bits of glass and metal­—“Duchamp is my trauma. He’s always in my head,” he said—as well as fossils he had placed, just so, in a hole in the entryway ceiling.Of course, it’s precisely this fusion of past and present that the 63-year-old Sugimoto savors: Not only will he show, say, a meteorite next to the Rembrandt print he remounted on a Japanese scroll, but his close friend, the Kyoto tea master Sen ­So-oku, 35—a direct descendant of the founder of the 16th-century Japanese tea ceremony—will preside over the inaugural ceremonies on October 29. The opening will coincide with ­Sugimoto’s latest exhibition of crystal pagodas and aluminum sculptures at the Pace Gallery in Chelsea.“It’s like a place to escape,” he said.

German artist Gerhard Richter poses in front of his work titled Funeral. Photograph: Norbert Millauer/AFP/Getty Images Gerhard Richter is a great artist. I don't mean that lightly. The German painter is sublime, profound, and authoritative in a way that invites high-flown comparisons and invocations of art history. And yet, his own utterances on art would suggest he finds such hyperbole repulsive, and is suspicious of anything that romanticises the creative act.I like sometimes just to wander through Tate Modern. The unpredictable nature of its displays means you never quite know what will hold and fascinate you. Anyway, I roamed into the room that contains nothing but Richter's series of abstract paintings entitled Cage (1-6) and it was like going from a claustrophobic interior into an expansive parkland where distant city lights flicker on half-frozen ponds. These paintings are liberating and time-freezing, sombre and ecstatic.Richter painted these six three-metre-square paintings in 2006, in homage to the composer and prophet of chance, John Cage. As that implies, they reject pompous ideas of the painter as designer, or the abstractionist as seer. The language I have used to describe them already implies a grandeur they eschew – for they are works of random experiment and play, not intense meditation.A courageous tendency in modern art finds beauty not in the depths, but the surfaces of things. Its most succinct proponent was Andy Warhol. Richter, too, believes that what you see is what you get, but what he sees is extraordinary. Photography allows him to see events he did not witness – such as the deaths in prison of members of the Baader-Meinhof gang. His series of black and white history paintings derived from photographs of their prison cells, faces and bodies look, with the silent intensity of the painter, through the images towards the events they record. He wonders, we wonder.In fact, Richter combines a Warholian openness with the powerful questioning gaze of a disciple of Cézanne. In his portraits and landscapes Cézanne questions, ceaselessly, the nature of his own looking. Who is that man there, in the mirror? His self-portrait in the National Gallery is fraught with this direst of questions. Richter inhabits, more fully than most, or more honestly than most, the photographic age, the digital age. He assimilates vast quantities of data. He paints what he sees, but what he sees comes second hand. A photograph is a piece of information to be digested, thought about, and remembered by his paintings.In his abstract paintings at Tate Modern, he does not resemble Cézanne so much as Monet. In the glides and slips, the luminous colour collisions and accidental symmetries of these tremendous works you seem to see – anyway, I seemed to see the other day – similar reflections of the ambiguity of experience to those that float in Monet's lily pond.Reality is profoundly ambiguous, modern physics tells us. An electron can be in two places at once. These paintings describe a world of uncertainty, without surrendering to despair. Richter is alive to the play of chance, the randomness of nature, the complexity of experience – yet proves that art can still bring something serious and beautiful out of the chaos. He towers above the artists of today. The German artist paints what he sees in photographs – and what he sees is extraordinary. But don't tell him I said that Artist of the photographic age ...

He wonders, we wonder.In fact, Richter combines a Warholian openness with the powerful questioning gaze of a disciple of Cézanne. In his portraits and landscapes Cézanne questions, ceaselessly, the nature of his own looking. Who is that man there, in the mirror? His self-portrait in the National Gallery is fraught with this direst of questions. Richter inhabits, more fully than most, or more honestly than most, the photographic age, the digital age. He assimilates vast quantities of data. He paints what he sees, but what he sees comes second hand. A photograph is a piece of information to be digested, thought about, and remembered by his paintings.In his abstract paintings at Tate Modern, he does not resemble Cézanne so much as Monet. In the glides and slips, the luminous colour collisions and accidental symmetries of these tremendous works you seem to see – anyway, I seemed to see the other day – similar reflections of the ambiguity of experience to those that float in Monet's lily pond.Reality is profoundly ambiguous, modern physics tells us. An electron can be in two places at once. These paintings describe a world of uncertainty, without surrendering to despair. Richter is alive to the play of chance, the randomness of nature, the complexity of experience – yet proves that art can still bring something serious and beautiful out of the chaos. He towers above the artists of today. The German artist paints what he sees in photographs – and what he sees is extraordinary. But don't tell him I said that Artist of the photographic age ... German artist Gerhard Richter poses in front of his work titled Funeral. Photograph: Norbert Millauer/AFP/Getty Images Gerhard Richter is a great artist. I don't mean that lightly. The German painter is sublime, profound, and authoritative in a way that invites high-flown comparisons and invocations of art history. And yet, his own utterances on art would suggest he finds such hyperbole repulsive, and is suspicious of anything that romanticises the creative act.I like sometimes just to wander through Tate Modern. The unpredictable nature of its displays means you never quite know what will hold and fascinate you. Anyway, I roamed into the room that contains nothing but Richter's series of abstract paintings entitled Cage (1-6) and it was like going from a claustrophobic interior into an expansive parkland where distant city lights flicker on half-frozen ponds. These paintings are liberating and time-freezing, sombre and ecstatic.Richter painted these six three-metre-square paintings in 2006, in homage to the composer and prophet of chance, John Cage. As that implies, they reject pompous ideas of the painter as designer, or the abstractionist as seer. The language I have used to describe them already implies a grandeur they eschew – for they are works of random experiment and play, not intense meditation.A courageous tendency in modern art finds beauty not in the depths, but the surfaces of things.

Click for the full image. Photograph: Gerhard Richter/Tate Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan has stunned visitors with the power of true genius, but where does that leave the art of today? Is there a genius at work in our century who can hold a candle to Leonardo?Hold up a candle to the old masters is exactly what Gerhard Richter does in one of the paintings in his powerful retrospective at Tate Modern. Candle, painted in 1982, has the clarity of a baroque picture such as the Magdalene with the Smoking Flame by Georges de La Tour. Except the light of the candle flame is still sharper and brighter than a painting by De La Tour, for – like all Richter's paintings – this is inflected by the mechanical eye of the camera. Like a blown-up photograph it is larger, too, than old paintings of candles usually are.Richter is fascinated by the new ways of seeing that are possible in the photographic age. When he paints cityscapes he paints them from the air, through the eye of aerial photography. One vast eerie landscape depicts the surface of the moon, which obviously Richter only knows through photography.It's well known to the point of cliche that this painter accepts the photograph as part of his apparatus. But what I never understood before was in how many ways the camera opens Richter's eye, and how energetically he shows these new perspectives to us. Obviously, I am not saying Richter is the modern equal of Leonardo da Vinci. If we have learned one thing in 2011 it is that no one is the equal of Leonardo da Vinci. But there is a parallel.When Leonardo mapped the city of Imola he produced what looks like an aerial photograph – but before the invention of either photography or flying. In his plans to build a flying machine he pointed out that it would be great for espionage (presumably with the pilot sketching as he flew). Leonardo would have seen the fascination of Richter's paintings based on aerial photography, and would also have recognised the power of his wide angled landscapes and mountains, which share the scope of Leonardo's own mountain views.Panorama is the right title: there is a true sense of the breadth and complexity of the world in this exhibition. The world enlarged, or seen from afar; the objective recording of intimate family life and the monumental preservation of random marks – all these Richterian strategies intersect in an art of intellectual grandeur.Richter is not a photographer. He is a painter. Often, the texts beside paintings in the exhibition seem curiously wide of the mark in their insistence that he is undermining this and subverting that. Is he really such an iconoclast?Richter uses the camera, as Degas did. But both are true painters, true masters. The shadows of European art grow in your memory as you absorb this show. Two paintings based on a photograph of lions killing a tourist echo, in scale and violence, the Lion Hunts of Rubens. Nearby, colossal paintings of clouds, based on photographs that Richter took himself, seduce the imagination into vertiginous daydreams. The text says they are not like emotional religious paintings of clouds ... but they are, you know.In German art, as in the art of Leonardo, radical shifts of perspective have often transformed vision. Albrecht Dürer's Great Piece of Turf, a detailed Renaissance study of a tiny bit of nature, is the direct ancestor of Richter's extreme viewpoints.Unsettled and unsettling, steady and relentless, the art of Gerhard Richter is revealed by this tremendous exhibition to be a wonder of our time.

        "text": "Of course no art, abstract or otherwise, is devoid of content (which doesn’t mean that there isn’t plenty of hollow work around). All art has meaning, intended or not, and part of the meaning of Mr. Richter’s is precisely to keep meaning on the move, to hide it, change it, multiply it, undermine it, all the while couching these feints and thrusts in visually ingratiating forms.Which brings us to the 50 drawings in the show, done in graphite, ink and watercolor on paper, dating from 1966 to 2005. A traditionally trained painter (an East German Socialist Realist in his youth) under the sway of Pop Art and Conceptualism, Mr. Richter, early in his career, viewed drawing — and its history as a vehicle for virtuosity — with suspicion, if not disdain. The only way he could approach it was indirectly, by taking its conventions apart, exposing its artifice.This is what he did in the large 1968 graphite drawing called “Mountains.” To create it, he first took a snapshot of a mountain landscape, that staple of German Romanticism. He then turned the photograph into a slide, projected the slide onto paper and drew the projected image. The result looks sort of like a mountain range but, clunkily traced, it resembles other things too: a hulking creature with staring eyes, a loaf of rye bread, a blob of inanimate matter, a space station.If “Mountains” turned out to be an elaborate joke about drawing’s vaunted capacity for realistic depiction, in another piece two years earlier Mr. Richter addressed its treasured reputation as an intimately personal medium. Again, he used mechanical intervention to make his point. He attached his pencil to an electric handle drill, plugged in the drill and went to work on a sheet of paper. The resulting clusters of jittery lines look more like termite tracks than a signature style. Photo A 1999 drawing, graphite on paper, by Gerhard Richter in the Drawing Center’s show “Lines Which Do Not Exist.” Credit Kunsthalle Emden In other drawings from the ’60s, Mr. Richter played around with architectural forms. One prophetic sketch shows the layout of a gallery installation of large, faintly lined drawings or paintings. Structural images continued into the ’70s, gradually growing more abstract — space opened up, line disengaged itself from representation — until, in the ’80s, abstraction more or less took over, though with no fixed themes or styles.Certain drawings seem to imitate, in graphite, the look and texture of paint strokes not so different from the big, artificially processed ones in Mr. Richter’s oil paintings of the time. And there are watercolor drawings that are really miniatures of those paintings, done in aquatic green and blue and rich vermilion.These pieces look freely gestural, but they aren’t: they’re products of chance. Mr. Richter made them pouring paint onto the paper, then distributing it by tilting the sheet this way and that.I don’t know how he executed several graphite works from 1986 that consist of little more than tangles of looping scribbles. These are barely drawings at all in the conventional sense of being deliberate designs. Yet from the same year we find what looks like a rough, adamant sketch of a skull, and from the year before an exquisitely modulated image of a nude female torso, a tour de force of academic realism that seems to have arrived from a different world.Anyone familiar with Mr. Richter’s painting knows that he uses similarly contrasting images and styles in that medium, as if telling us that he planned to keep his options open. This has allowed him to sample from a range of art histories without swearing allegiance to any, to make a sweeping formal investigation of painting without declaring his absolute faith in it.In 1999, Mr. Richter agreed to a proposal by the Kunstmuseum Winterthur in Zurich to do an exhibition of his drawings, accompanied by a catalogue raisonné. For the occasion he made 45 new pieces. Several are at the Drawing Center, and they are extraordinary. In them, one senses that a long-maintained distance from the medium is gone; the artist is engaging drawing on its own material terms.The 1999 pieces, over all, are elaborately tactile looking. Entire sheets are covered with a layer of lightly rubbed graphite that brings out the grain of the paper and gives it graphic life. Areas of smudging create an illusion of shadowy spatial depth, against and within which linear forms float. In addition, there is lots of patterning: clouds of black dots trailing cometlike tails form drifting nebulae, which recur from piece to piece, helping to give the group cohesion.Several of these components are both simplified and amplified in a set of four exceptionally large drawings from 2005, the most recent works in the show. Vertically oriented, they are entirely abstract but with passages of volumetric shading that suggest a concealed third dimension. Like Mr. Richter’s “Four Panes of Glass” from 1967 — and the panels in the ’60s gallery drawing — they’re environmental in scale, the size of the doors or tall windows big enough to walk into. Yet they don’t invite entry. Something about them is closed off. As with most of this artist’s work, access, apparently encouraged, goes just so far.These drawings, which are really a single piece, hang together on one wall. But otherwise the show, organized by Gavin Delahunty, a curator at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art in England, mixes work from different eras, often in clusters of pieces set on shelves. This is a smart arrangement; it points up consistencies over a career’s span but also creates an impression of surprise and variety in the work as a whole.This is particularly important in a show that invites careful, lingering scrutiny from start to finish. In the end Mr. Richter remains as enigmatic an artist as ever. Whatever questions you ask of his art still yield conflicting answers. But you won’t find a more intimate setting for asking those questions than this one.Continue reading the main storyOf course no art, abstract or otherwise, is devoid of content (which doesn’t mean that there isn’t plenty of hollow work around).

        "text": "In 2003, Gerhard Richter made several paintings with the same title: Silicate. Large oil-on-canvas pieces, these show latticed rows of light- and dark-grey blobs whose shapes quasi-repeat as they race across the frame, their angle modulating from painting to painting. When angled horizontally, they suggest strips of film bearing identical (or near-identical) sequences but running at different speeds, all of them too fast for any image-content to be made out; when angled askew, they suggest out-of-focus close-ups of a bathmat or worn carpet – or, perhaps, aerial views, similarly out-of-focus, of a gridded city.In fact, what they're actually depicting is a photo, plucked from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, of a computer-generated simulacrum of reflections from the silicon dioxide found in insects' shells. The compound is a prime ingredient of window glass and fibre-optic cable; a semi-conductor, it's also a mainstay of computer chips. The article accompanying the source photo described research being conducted into structural colours – that is, colours that result from surface textures that refract, rather than contain, pigment. What seems, at first glance, an op art abstraction thus turns out, when unpacked, to contain an entire disquisition on the meshing of the \"natural\" world (insects) with its synthetic reproductions both inherent (shell-reflections) and exterior (scientific visual modelling); on the surfaces through which we look (windows) and vectors along which we relay or broadcast information (cables); on digital technology; and on colour and its spectrum – which, of course, means both on painting and on light itself, the very ground and possibility of vision.There's a tendency to discuss the art of the past hundred years in terms of binary oppositions: abstract versus figurative; conceptual versus craft-based; painting versus photography; and so on. Richter, who since the 1970s has been almost universally acknowledged as a late-modern master, reduces these binaries to rubble. Here's a painter whose work is inseparable from photography; a man so devoted to craft that he reportedly makes his students construct their own pallet-trolleys before allowing them to raise a brush in anger, yet indulges in Joseph Beuys-style performances in which he lounges on a staircase grasping a wire (as in the 1968 piece Cable Energy), or Debordian critiques of consumer culture in which he installs himself on pedestal-mounted furniture amid a soundscape of advertising slogans (as in the 1963 piece Living with Pop: A Demonstration of Capitalist Realism); who exhibits colour-charts alongside pastoral landscapes; places mirrors around his paintings; photographs a single grey brushstroke from 128 different angles and lays these out in a large grid; or projects a yellow one, massively enlarged, on to fresh canvas and repaints it as a giant 20-metre streak … I could go on and on: his versatility and scope are stunning.Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter studied at the city's Academy of Fine Arts, then worked as a darkroom assistant and socialist-realist muralist before fleeing the DDR for Düsseldorf in 1961. Even before he left, he'd been exposed to such western figures as the canvas-slashing Lucio Fontana and the paint-dribbling Jackson Pollock, and his earliest work betrays their influence. The piece that he himself presents as his first \"proper\" one, though, painted in 1962, depicts, in sober tones and utterly representational mode, a plain white table – or, rather, would depict this if it weren't for the large blur sitting at the picture's centre. The unlikely combination is pure Richter: a preoccupation with the everyday and unadorned (a favourite expression of his, repeated in numerous correspondence, is Es ist wie's ist: \"it is what it is\"), married to a sense of some kinetic violence lurking either at the heart of these or at the interface between them and the viewer. Subsequent paintings – of toilet-roll holders, or of promotional pictures of new makes of car, or holidaying families posing for a snapshot, or statesmen blinking in the flashbulb glare of public scrutiny, or tribesmen doing the same before National Geographic's gaze – would repeatedly involve some form of blurring: it quickly became Richter's trademark.What is a blur? It's a corruption of an image, an assault upon its clarity, one that turns transparent lenses into opaque shower curtains, gauzy veils. Richter painted a lot of curtains; he had a curtain-painting hanging in his Düsseldorf studio, beside the curtain. He had left his own past behind an iron one; many of the blurred snapshot-scenes he produced in the 60s were of relatives he'd never see again, childhood locations become inaccessible. Beyond reflecting his own situation, the blur serves as a perfect general metaphor for memory, its degradation, for the Ozymandian corrosion wrought by time. One blurred Richter painting reproduces badly taken tourist snaps of Egypt, in which pyramids and temples lose their shapes and scale and grandeur. \"I blur to make everything equal, everything equally important and equally unimportant,\" he explained.Flashbulbs, snapshots, reportage: above all else, the blur recalls camera movement and errors of printing. The vast majority of Richter's paintings aren't directly \"of\" the thing they purport to show, but rather of magazine or photo-album reproductions of it. He'll often hammer this point home by including surrounding text: captions and advertising copy, scrapbook annotations – which, of course, blur too. What Richter is at pains to foreground is the fact of mediation, the presence, at the very origin and base of every piece, of technologies of mass-production, of repetition. He not only overwrites our perceptual relation to the world by rerouting it through its glitch-ridden mediating screens; he also brings this logic to bear on the history of art. He remakes Vermeer's Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, not only hazing it up but also, vitally, replacing the letter the original figure holds in her fingers – a unique, hand-written article with one addressee – with a newspaper: an impersonal, mass-produced media object. Blurring up Titian's Annunciation, he turns the image into what, for 99% of its viewers, it already was: a reproduction of a reproduction, a third-generation bootleg.That Richter homes in on the annunciation is doubly significant, since Titian's masterpiece concerns itself with divine revelation, with the act of making known. Throughout Richter's oeuvre, a double-play is going on, a struggle being fought within each work between showing and hiding, with the result that each work performs a logic-defying feat of hiding-in-the-act-of-showing, of revealing hiddenness itself. In a recent interview with Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, Richter waxes all Heideggerean – or, in fact, Rumsfeldian – when Serota asks him: \"Do you think painting is about discovering the unknown or the known?\" The \"known,\" he answers, \"which we see and experience, which effects us and we have to react to … that is the most important thing\" – but then, in an immediate volte-face, he goes on to claim that when a subject \"turns into the unknown, into what it was, that has an excitement all of its own\". Painting, he concludes, has to retain \"something incomprehensible\".On occasion his own works have, despite their patina of opaque non-disclosure, divulged secrets of which even he was unaware. Two snapshot-derived paintings from 1965 and 1966, a nondescript image of the infant Richter with his aunt, and an equally generic childhood picture of his first wife and her family standing by a snowy road, seemed unconnected when he made them. But it transpired, years later, that the father-in-law posing in the second was a Nazi gynaecologist who had sterilised scores of mentally ill women in the same district in which the aunt in the first work, a schizophrenic, had herself been sterilised and euthanised in 1945. The subject of one painting had, at least by association and quite possibly literally, killed the subject of the other.There's always violence lurking within Richter's images. When, in 1968, he painted aerial views of cities, the series was automatically framed by the bomber-planes he'd painted five years earlier. In Townscape Paris, buildings and monuments melt and implode in a series of streaks and smears. Is this paint smudging, or is he picturing the city being nuked? The ambiguity is deliberate: destruction is absorbed into the very act of representing; painting and bombing become one and the same gesture. No sooner had he finished this series than he turned his attention to mountain ranges, blasting their peaks to ruins through the formal modulations to which he subjected them.A later series, from 1975, is so blurred that it will strike most viewers as entirely abstract – until the two main words in all the works' titles, \"tourist\" and \"lion\", prompt them to squint and pick out the safari-goer being ripped apart. Again, form and subject matter merge completely in the veiled divulgence of a ferocious primal scene: the paint becomes the lion, devouring figuration in a frenzy of power and movement. By the 80s Richter was dragging squeegees across paintings' surfaces, smearing (over the next two decades) everything from Venice to a forest to his third wife and newborn child in an astonishing annihilation of the difference between marking and erasing, revealing and obscuring, creating and destroying.Richter's most famous series is October 18, 1977. Painted 11 years after the events they address, the 15 works – grey, small and undramatic – show members of the Baader-Meinhof group: a youthful picture; a post-capture mugshot; the record-player in which a gun was smuggled into prison and so on. Derived from press and police photographs that Richter, naturally, has blurred, the images are remarkable for the dual pull they exert towards, on the one hand, monumentality and, on the other, monochrome monotony. In another recent interview, Richter uses the term ansehnlich (\"considerable\") to describe the effect of rescuing an image from the endless rush of media and paying it the attention – the devotion, we could say – of crafting it into a unique work of art. The Baader-Meinhof paintings are ansehnlich, to be sure – but they're neither heroic nor condemnatory nor in any way resolved. \"Their horror,\" Richter says, \"is the horror of the hard-to-bear refusal to answer, to explain, to give an opinion.\" The pictures, ultra-loaded as they are, reject any attempt to bring their subject matter into focus along perspectival lines of ideology or pathos or transcendence. They represent, as Richter puts it, \"a leave-taking from any specific doctrine of salvation\". History is not there to be redeemed and held up in divine synthesis, least of all through art: rather, like a chair, or toilet-roll holder, or gramophone, Es ist wie's ist.Since 1972, Richter has intermittently exhibited, under the title Atlas, the vast, ever-expanding collection of source-images from which his work is drawn (he's also published it in book form with the same title). Atlas, perhaps, is Richter's greatest work, because it contains all the others. Flipping through it is like picking through the entrails – or, perhaps more fittingly, the source-code – of not only Richter's work but also the 20th century and, perhaps, of western art in its entirety. Here are bombs, fridges, hard-core porn, the surface of the moon; here's a cruise ship, an electric light, a waterfall, a diver frozen in mid-somersault, the image over-gridded; here's a warship, a suburban street, stags on a mountain, heaps of bodies in an Auschwitz yard. Here are the Baader-Meinhof photos; here's that hapless tourist with his lions; here's one of Richter's own doodles.The pictures are ordered by their formal qualities – colour-gradations, shapes and angles – rather than thematically, which sets up a visual taxonomy in which all subjects are both reduced to equal terms and augmented by their juxtaposition with the others. He intervenes in many of the images, sticking lines of tape on urban sprawls to identify their axes, or extrapolating the pattern of a tower block's stacked-up balconies, repeating this in the next image as pure abstract geometry, then morphing it back into a sketch of plinths for an imaginary exhibition of his work. It's as though, like some symbolic safe-cracker, he were running through all possible combinations and all modulations of the world's image-bank; or, like some ancient gnostic monk or rabbi, reeling off the mutating names of God in an incantatory votive list with neither origin nor end – the vital difference being that Richter's universe is godless. This, perversely, makes it all the more revelatory, in the sense that the philosopher Giorgio Agamben uses the term: profane without redemption, just irreparably thus.When, in 2007, the atheist Richter was commissioned to design a stained-glass window for Cologne's cathedral, he had coloured squares installed in electronically generated random configurations, parts of which he then repeated across the 113-square-metre space – again, extrapolating patterns, taxonomising the forms and sequences chance throws out. The work caused a furore, with a cardinal complaining (using, albeit inadvertently, delightfully apt language) that the work doesn't \"clearly reflect our faith\". Too right it doesn't. From an art perspective, though, what's more important than Richter's rejection of the divine is his parallel rebuffal of the sublime. Like virtually all German artists of his generation, Richter at times conducts a dialogue with Romanticism. But road signs replace church spires in his landscapes; waves and clouds are fragmented, isolated, collaged and inverted; icebergs are laid out in multiplying rows, as in school geography textbooks. The fascination is retained – but it's a fascination voided of sublimity, wedded instead to repetition, reproduction, an interrogation of the act of looking and the technologies through which this act takes place.Here, as everywhere in Richter's work, the gaze – of the artist, of the viewer – has been purged of sentimentality, of ideologies of \"naturalness\". This is what sets him head and shoulders above his contemporaries Beuys and Anselm Kiefer – who, for all their brilliance, fall into the trap of uncritically reiterating the Romantic aesthetic that segued so seamlessy, with its fetishes of blood and earth, its sentimentalising of history, into Nazism and finds its contemporary expression in vague cultural notions of authenticity and \"spirituality\". To make the leap beyond such consoling and reactionary banalities – and to do this without getting snared in that other trap, the one so much of Britart made its home in, namely irony – that is the aesthetic challenge of our era.Richter's series September, and numbered \"series No 911\" in his internal cataloguing system, grew from a notebook drawing – an extrapolated mutation of who knows how many other mutated images – that he considered abstract until his friend, the art historian Benjamin Buchloh, looked at it and said: \"Oh, that's the World Trade Center being attacked.\" The twin towers loom into view, in the completed series, out of shockingly gorgeous light-blue backgrounds, before disappearing, at each painting's top, in clouds of billowing grey, while small metallic streaks – denoting planes, or media, or violence, or perhaps just paint – blur as they hurtle across the canvas.In 2003, Gerhard Richter made several paintings with the same title: Silicate. Large oil-on-canvas pieces, these show latticed rows of light- and dark-grey blobs whose shapes quasi-repeat as they race across the frame, their angle modulating from painting to painting. When angled horizontally, they suggest strips of film bearing identical (or near-identical) sequences but running at different speeds, all of them too fast for any image-content to be made out; when angled askew, they suggest out-of-focus close-ups of a bathmat or worn carpet – or, perhaps, aerial views, similarly out-of-focus, of a gridded city.In fact, what they're actually depicting is a photo, plucked from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, of a computer-generated simulacrum of reflections from the silicon dioxide found in insects' shells.

Here's a painter whose work is inseparable from photography; a man so devoted to craft that he reportedly makes his students construct their own pallet-trolleys before allowing them to raise a brush in anger, yet indulges in Joseph Beuys-style performances in which he lounges on a staircase grasping a wire (as in the 1968 piece Cable Energy), or Debordian critiques of consumer culture in which he installs himself on pedestal-mounted furniture amid a soundscape of advertising slogans (as in the 1963 piece Living with Pop: A Demonstration of Capitalist Realism); who exhibits colour-charts alongside pastoral landscapes; places mirrors around his paintings; photographs a single grey brushstroke from 128 different angles and lays these out in a large grid; or projects a yellow one, massively enlarged, on to fresh canvas and repaints it as a giant 20-metre streak … I could go on and on: his versatility and scope are stunning.Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter studied at the city's Academy of Fine Arts, then worked as a darkroom assistant and socialist-realist muralist before fleeing the DDR for Düsseldorf in 1961. Even before he left, he'd been exposed to such western figures as the canvas-slashing Lucio Fontana and the paint-dribbling Jackson Pollock, and his earliest work betrays their influence. The piece that he himself presents as his first \"proper\" one, though, painted in 1962, depicts, in sober tones and utterly representational mode, a plain white table – or, rather, would depict this if it weren't for the large blur sitting at the picture's centre. The unlikely combination is pure Richter: a preoccupation with the everyday and unadorned (a favourite expression of his, repeated in numerous correspondence, is Es ist wie's ist: \"it is what it is\"), married to a sense of some kinetic violence lurking either at the heart of these or at the interface between them and the viewer. Subsequent paintings – of toilet-roll holders, or of promotional pictures of new makes of car, or holidaying families posing for a snapshot, or statesmen blinking in the flashbulb glare of public scrutiny, or tribesmen doing the same before National Geographic's gaze – would repeatedly involve some form of blurring: it quickly became Richter's trademark.What is a blur? It's a corruption of an image, an assault upon its clarity, one that turns transparent lenses into opaque shower curtains, gauzy veils. Richter painted a lot of curtains; he had a curtain-painting hanging in his Düsseldorf studio, beside the curtain. He had left his own past behind an iron one; many of the blurred snapshot-scenes he produced in the 60s were of relatives he'd never see again, childhood locations become inaccessible. Beyond reflecting his own situation, the blur serves as a perfect general metaphor for memory, its degradation, for the Ozymandian corrosion wrought by time. One blurred Richter painting reproduces badly taken tourist snaps of Egypt, in which pyramids and temples lose their shapes and scale and grandeur. \"I blur to make everything equal, everything equally important and equally unimportant,\" he explained.Flashbulbs, snapshots, reportage: above all else, the blur recalls camera movement and errors of printing. The vast majority of Richter's paintings aren't directly \"of\" the thing they purport to show, but rather of magazine or photo-album reproductions of it. He'll often hammer this point home by including surrounding text: captions and advertising copy, scrapbook annotations – which, of course, blur too. What Richter is at pains to foreground is the fact of mediation, the presence, at the very origin and base of every piece, of technologies of mass-production, of repetition. He not only overwrites our perceptual relation to the world by rerouting it through its glitch-ridden mediating screens; he also brings this logic to bear on the history of art. He remakes Vermeer's Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, not only hazing it up but also, vitally, replacing the letter the original figure holds in her fingers – a unique, hand-written article with one addressee – with a newspaper: an impersonal, mass-produced media object. Blurring up Titian's Annunciation, he turns the image into what, for 99% of its viewers, it already was: a reproduction of a reproduction, a third-generation bootleg.That Richter homes in on the annunciation is doubly significant, since Titian's masterpiece concerns itself with divine revelation, with the act of making known. Throughout Richter's oeuvre, a double-play is going on, a struggle being fought within each work between showing and hiding, with the result that each work performs a logic-defying feat of hiding-in-the-act-of-showing, of revealing hiddenness itself. In a recent interview with Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, Richter waxes all Heideggerean – or, in fact, Rumsfeldian – when Serota asks him: \"Do you think painting is about discovering the unknown or the known?\" The \"known,\" he answers, \"which we see and experience, which effects us and we have to react to … that is the most important thing\" – but then, in an immediate volte-face, he goes on to claim that when a subject \"turns into the unknown, into what it was, that has an excitement all of its own\". Painting, he concludes, has to retain \"something incomprehensible\".On occasion his own works have, despite their patina of opaque non-disclosure, divulged secrets of which even he was unaware. Two snapshot-derived paintings from 1965 and 1966, a nondescript image of the infant Richter with his aunt, and an equally generic childhood picture of his first wife and her family standing by a snowy road, seemed unconnected when he made them. But it transpired, years later, that the father-in-law posing in the second was a Nazi gynaecologist who had sterilised scores of mentally ill women in the same district in which the aunt in the first work, a schizophrenic, had herself been sterilised and euthanised in 1945. The subject of one painting had, at least by association and quite possibly literally, killed the subject of the other.There's always violence lurking within Richter's images. When, in 1968, he painted aerial views of cities, the series was automatically framed by the bomber-planes he'd painted five years earlier. In Townscape Paris, buildings and monuments melt and implode in a series of streaks and smears. Is this paint smudging, or is he picturing the city being nuked? The ambiguity is deliberate: destruction is absorbed into the very act of representing; painting and bombing become one and the same gesture. No sooner had he finished this series than he turned his attention to mountain ranges, blasting their peaks to ruins through the formal modulations to which he subjected them.A later series, from 1975, is so blurred that it will strike most viewers as entirely abstract – until the two main words in all the works' titles, \"tourist\" and \"lion\", prompt them to squint and pick out the safari-goer being ripped apart. Again, form and subject matter merge completely in the veiled divulgence of a ferocious primal scene: the paint becomes the lion, devouring figuration in a frenzy of power and movement. By the 80s Richter was dragging squeegees across paintings' surfaces, smearing (over the next two decades) everything from Venice to a forest to his third wife and newborn child in an astonishing annihilation of the difference between marking and erasing, revealing and obscuring, creating and destroying.Richter's most famous series is October 18, 1977. Painted 11 years after the events they address, the 15 works – grey, small and undramatic – show members of the Baader-Meinhof group: a youthful picture; a post-capture mugshot; the record-player in which a gun was smuggled into prison and so on. Derived from press and police photographs that Richter, naturally, has blurred, the images are remarkable for the dual pull they exert towards, on the one hand, monumentality and, on the other, monochrome monotony. In another recent interview, Richter uses the term ansehnlich (\"considerable\") to describe the effect of rescuing an image from the endless rush of media and paying it the attention – the devotion, we could say – of crafting it into a unique work of art. The Baader-Meinhof paintings are ansehnlich, to be sure – but they're neither heroic nor condemnatory nor in any way resolved. \"Their horror,\" Richter says, \"is the horror of the hard-to-bear refusal to answer, to explain, to give an opinion.\" The pictures, ultra-loaded as they are, reject any attempt to bring their subject matter into focus along perspectival lines of ideology or pathos or transcendence. They represent, as Richter puts it, \"a leave-taking from any specific doctrine of salvation\". History is not there to be redeemed and held up in divine synthesis, least of all through art: rather, like a chair, or toilet-roll holder, or gramophone, Es ist wie's ist.Since 1972, Richter has intermittently exhibited, under the title Atlas, the vast, ever-expanding collection of source-images from which his work is drawn (he's also published it in book form with the same title). Atlas, perhaps, is Richter's greatest work, because it contains all the others. Flipping through it is like picking through the entrails – or, perhaps more fittingly, the source-code – of not only Richter's work but also the 20th century and, perhaps, of western art in its entirety. Here are bombs, fridges, hard-core porn, the surface of the moon; here's a cruise ship, an electric light, a waterfall, a diver frozen in mid-somersault, the image over-gridded; here's a warship, a suburban street, stags on a mountain, heaps of bodies in an Auschwitz yard. Here are the Baader-Meinhof photos; here's that hapless tourist with his lions; here's one of Richter's own doodles.The pictures are ordered by their formal qualities – colour-gradations, shapes and angles – rather than thematically, which sets up a visual taxonomy in which all subjects are both reduced to equal terms and augmented by their juxtaposition with the others. He intervenes in many of the images, sticking lines of tape on urban sprawls to identify their axes, or extrapolating the pattern of a tower block's stacked-up balconies, repeating this in the next image as pure abstract geometry, then morphing it back into a sketch of plinths for an imaginary exhibition of his work. It's as though, like some symbolic safe-cracker, he were running through all possible combinations and all modulations of the world's image-bank; or, like some ancient gnostic monk or rabbi, reeling off the mutating names of God in an incantatory votive list with neither origin nor end – the vital difference being that Richter's universe is godless. This, perversely, makes it all the more revelatory, in the sense that the philosopher Giorgio Agamben uses the term: profane without redemption, just irreparably thus.When, in 2007, the atheist Richter was commissioned to design a stained-glass window for Cologne's cathedral, he had coloured squares installed in electronically generated random configurations, parts of which he then repeated across the 113-square-metre space – again, extrapolating patterns, taxonomising the forms and sequences chance throws out. The work caused a furore, with a cardinal complaining (using, albeit inadvertently, delightfully apt language) that the work doesn't \"clearly reflect our faith\". Too right it doesn't. From an art perspective, though, what's more important than Richter's rejection of the divine is his parallel rebuffal of the sublime. Like virtually all German artists of his generation, Richter at times conducts a dialogue with Romanticism. But road signs replace church spires in his landscapes; waves and clouds are fragmented, isolated, collaged and inverted; icebergs are laid out in multiplying rows, as in school geography textbooks. The fascination is retained – but it's a fascination voided of sublimity, wedded instead to repetition, reproduction, an interrogation of the act of looking and the technologies through which this act takes place.Here, as everywhere in Richter's work, the gaze – of the artist, of the viewer – has been purged of sentimentality, of ideologies of \"naturalness\". This is what sets him head and shoulders above his contemporaries Beuys and Anselm Kiefer – who, for all their brilliance, fall into the trap of uncritically reiterating the Romantic aesthetic that segued so seamlessy, with its fetishes of blood and earth, its sentimentalising of history, into Nazism and finds its contemporary expression in vague cultural notions of authenticity and \"spirituality\". To make the leap beyond such consoling and reactionary banalities – and to do this without getting snared in that other trap, the one so much of Britart made its home in, namely irony – that is the aesthetic challenge of our era.Richter's series September, and numbered \"series No 911\" in his internal cataloguing system, grew from a notebook drawing – an extrapolated mutation of who knows how many other mutated images – that he considered abstract until his friend, the art historian Benjamin Buchloh, looked at it and said: \"Oh, that's the World Trade Center being attacked.\" The twin towers loom into view, in the completed series, out of shockingly gorgeous light-blue backgrounds, before disappearing, at each painting's top, in clouds of billowing grey, while small metallic streaks – denoting planes, or media, or violence, or perhaps just paint – blur as they hurtle across the canvas.In 2003, Gerhard Richter made several paintings with the same title: Silicate. Large oil-on-canvas pieces, these show latticed rows of light- and dark-grey blobs whose shapes quasi-repeat as they race across the frame, their angle modulating from painting to painting. When angled horizontally, they suggest strips of film bearing identical (or near-identical) sequences but running at different speeds, all of them too fast for any image-content to be made out; when angled askew, they suggest out-of-focus close-ups of a bathmat or worn carpet – or, perhaps, aerial views, similarly out-of-focus, of a gridded city.In fact, what they're actually depicting is a photo, plucked from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, of a computer-generated simulacrum of reflections from the silicon dioxide found in insects' shells. The compound is a prime ingredient of window glass and fibre-optic cable; a semi-conductor, it's also a mainstay of computer chips. The article accompanying the source photo described research being conducted into structural colours – that is, colours that result from surface textures that refract, rather than contain, pigment. What seems, at first glance, an op art abstraction thus turns out, when unpacked, to contain an entire disquisition on the meshing of the \"natural\" world (insects) with its synthetic reproductions both inherent (shell-reflections) and exterior (scientific visual modelling); on the surfaces through which we look (windows) and vectors along which we relay or broadcast information (cables); on digital technology; and on colour and its spectrum – which, of course, means both on painting and on light itself, the very ground and possibility of vision.There's a tendency to discuss the art of the past hundred years in terms of binary oppositions: abstract versus figurative; conceptual versus craft-based; painting versus photography; and so on. Richter, who since the 1970s has been almost universally acknowledged as a late-modern master, reduces these binaries to rubble. Here's a painter whose work is inseparable from photography; a man so devoted to craft that he reportedly makes his students construct their own pallet-trolleys before allowing them to raise a brush in anger, yet indulges in Joseph Beuys-style performances in which he lounges on a staircase grasping a wire (as in the 1968 piece Cable Energy), or Debordian critiques of consumer culture in which he installs himself on pedestal-mounted furniture amid a soundscape of advertising slogans (as in the 1963 piece Living with Pop: A Demonstration of Capitalist Realism); who exhibits colour-charts alongside pastoral landscapes; places mirrors around his paintings; photographs a single grey brushstroke from 128 different angles and lays these out in a large grid; or projects a yellow one, massively enlarged, on to fresh canvas and repaints it as a giant 20-metre streak … I could go on and on: his versatility and scope are stunning.Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter studied at the city's Academy of Fine Arts, then worked as a darkroom assistant and socialist-realist muralist before fleeing the DDR for Düsseldorf in 1961.

Blurring up Titian's Annunciation, he turns the image into what, for 99% of its viewers, it already was: a reproduction of a reproduction, a third-generation bootleg.Girl Reading a Letter at an Open WindowGirl Reading a Letter at an Open Windowreplacing the letter the original figureAnnunciationAnnunciationThat Richter homes in on the annunciation is doubly significant, since Titian's masterpiece concerns itself with divine revelation, with the act of making known. Throughout Richter's oeuvre, a double-play is going on, a struggle being fought within each work between showing and hiding, with the result that each work performs a logic-defying feat of hiding-in-the-act-of-showing, of revealing hiddenness itself. In a recent interview with Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, Richter waxes all Heideggerean – or, in fact, Rumsfeldian – when Serota asks him: \"Do you think painting is about discovering the unknown or the known?\" The \"known,\" he answers, \"which we see and experience, which effects us and we have to react to … that is the most important thing\" – but then, in an immediate volte-face, he goes on to claim that when a subject \"turns into the unknown, into what it was, that has an excitement all of its own\". Painting, he concludes, has to retain \"something incomprehensible\".PaintingOn occasion his own works have, despite their patina of opaque non-disclosure, divulged secrets of which even he was unaware. Two snapshot-derived paintings from 1965 and 1966, a nondescript image of the infant Richter with his aunt, and an equally generic childhood picture of his first wife and her family standing by a snowy road, seemed unconnected when he made them. But it transpired, years later, that the father-in-law posing in the second was a Nazi gynaecologist who had sterilised scores of mentally ill women in the same district in which the aunt in the first work, a schizophrenic, had herself been sterilised and euthanised in 1945. The subject of one painting had, at least by association and quite possibly literally, killed the subject of the other.There's always violence lurking within Richter's images. When, in 1968, he painted aerial views of cities, the series was automatically framed by the bomber-planes he'd painted five years earlier. In Townscape Paris, buildings and monuments melt and implode in a series of streaks and smears. Is this paint smudging, or is he picturing the city being nuked? The ambiguity is deliberate: destruction is absorbed into the very act of representing; painting and bombing become one and the same gesture. No sooner had he finished this series than he turned his attention to mountain ranges, blasting their peaks to ruins through the formal modulations to which he subjected them.Townscape ParisTownscape ParisA later series, from 1975, is so blurred that it will strike most viewers as entirely abstract – until the two main words in all the works' titles, \"tourist\" and \"lion\", prompt them to squint and pick out the safari-goer being ripped apart. Again, form and subject matter merge completely in the veiled divulgence of a ferocious primal scene: the paint becomes the lion, devouring figuration in a frenzy of power and movement. By the 80s Richter was dragging squeegees across paintings' surfaces, smearing (over the next two decades) everything from Venice to a forest to his third wife and newborn child in an astonishing annihilation of the difference between marking and erasing, revealing and obscuring, creating and destroying.Richter's most famous series is October 18, 1977. Painted 11 years after the events they address, the 15 works – grey, small and undramatic – show members of the Baader-Meinhof group: a youthful picture; a post-capture mugshot; the record-player in which a gun was smuggled into prison and so on. Derived from press and police photographs that Richter, naturally, has blurred, the images are remarkable for the dual pull they exert towards, on the one hand, monumentality and, on the other, monochrome monotony. In another recent interview, Richter uses the term ansehnlich (\"considerable\") to describe the effect of rescuing an image from the endless rush of media and paying it the attention – the devotion, we could say – of crafting it into a unique work of art. The Baader-Meinhof paintings are ansehnlich, to be sure – but they're neither heroic nor condemnatory nor in any way resolved. \"Their horror,\" Richter says, \"is the horror of the hard-to-bear refusal to answer, to explain, to give an opinion.\" The pictures, ultra-loaded as they are, reject any attempt to bring their subject matter into focus along perspectival lines of ideology or pathos or transcendence. They represent, as Richter puts it, \"a leave-taking from any specific doctrine of salvation\". History is not there to be redeemed and held up in divine synthesis, least of all through art: rather, like a chair, or toilet-roll holder, or gramophone, Es ist wie's ist.October 18, 1977October 18, 1977ansehnlichansehnlichEs ist wie's istSince 1972, Richter has intermittently exhibited, under the title Atlas, the vast, ever-expanding collection of source-images from which his work is drawn (he's also published it in book form with the same title). Atlas, perhaps, is Richter's greatest work, because it contains all the others. Flipping through it is like picking through the entrails – or, perhaps more fittingly, the source-code – of not only Richter's work but also the 20th century and, perhaps, of western art in its entirety. Here are bombs, fridges, hard-core porn, the surface of the moon; here's a cruise ship, an electric light, a waterfall, a diver frozen in mid-somersault, the image over-gridded; here's a warship, a suburban street, stags on a mountain, heaps of bodies in an Auschwitz yard. Here are the Baader-Meinhof photos; here's that hapless tourist with his lions; here's one of Richter's own doodles.AtlasAtlasAtlasThe pictures are ordered by their formal qualities – colour-gradations, shapes and angles – rather than thematically, which sets up a visual taxonomy in which all subjects are both reduced to equal terms and augmented by their juxtaposition with the others. He intervenes in many of the images, sticking lines of tape on urban sprawls to identify their axes, or extrapolating the pattern of a tower block's stacked-up balconies, repeating this in the next image as pure abstract geometry, then morphing it back into a sketch of plinths for an imaginary exhibition of his work. It's as though, like some symbolic safe-cracker, he were running through all possible combinations and all modulations of the world's image-bank; or, like some ancient gnostic monk or rabbi, reeling off the mutating names of God in an incantatory votive list with neither origin nor end – the vital difference being that Richter's universe is godless. This, perversely, makes it all the more revelatory, in the sense that the philosopher Giorgio Agamben uses the term: profane without redemption, just irreparably thus.Giorgio AgambenWhen, in 2007, the atheist Richter was commissioned to design a stained-glass window for Cologne's cathedral, he had coloured squares installed in electronically generated random configurations, parts of which he then repeated across the 113-square-metre space – again, extrapolating patterns, taxonomising the forms and sequences chance throws out. The work caused a furore, with a cardinal complaining (using, albeit inadvertently, delightfully apt language) that the work doesn't \"clearly reflect our faith\". Too right it doesn't. From an art perspective, though, what's more important than Richter's rejection of the divine is his parallel rebuffal of the sublime. Like virtually all German artists of his generation, Richter at times conducts a dialogue with Romanticism. But road signs replace church spires in his landscapes; waves and clouds are fragmented, isolated, collaged and inverted; icebergs are laid out in multiplying rows, as in school geography textbooks. The fascination is retained – but it's a fascination voided of sublimity, wedded instead to repetition, reproduction, an interrogation of the act of looking and the technologies through which this act takes place.Cologne's cathedralHere, as everywhere in Richter's work, the gaze – of the artist, of the viewer – has been purged of sentimentality, of ideologies of \"naturalness\". This is what sets him head and shoulders above his contemporaries Beuys and Anselm Kiefer – who, for all their brilliance, fall into the trap of uncritically reiterating the Romantic aesthetic that segued so seamlessy, with its fetishes of blood and earth, its sentimentalising of history, into Nazism and finds its contemporary expression in vague cultural notions of authenticity and \"spirituality\". To make the leap beyond such consoling and reactionary banalities – and to do this without getting snared in that other trap, the one so much of Britart made its home in, namely irony – that is the aesthetic challenge of our era.Anselm KieferRichter's series September, and numbered \"series No 911\" in his internal cataloguing system, grew from a notebook drawing – an extrapolated mutation of who knows how many other mutated images – that he considered abstract until his friend, the art historian Benjamin Buchloh, looked at it and said: \"Oh, that's the World Trade Center being attacked.\" The twin towers loom into view, in the completed series, out of shockingly gorgeous light-blue backgrounds, before disappearing, at each painting's top, in clouds of billowing grey, while small metallic streaks – denoting planes, or media, or violence, or perhaps just paint – blur as they hurtle across the canvas.SeptemberBenjamin Buchloh"

        "text": "Don DeLillo's bleak short story \"Looking at Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The meeting takes place in the room displaying October 18, 1977 (1988), Gerhard Richter's remarkable suite of 15 canvases ruminating on the alleged suicide/death/police murder of Andreas Baader and other members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in a German prison in 1977. The man in the story, it transpires, is killing time between job interviews. The woman, though, is in thrall to the cycle of paintings.\"I realise now that the first day I was only barely looking. I thought I was looking, but I was only getting a bare inkling of what's in these paintings. I'm only just starting to look ... I think I feel helpless. These paintings make me feel how helpless a person can be.\"She has developed an obsession with the multiple images of Ulrike Meinhof dead in her cell (\"the head, the neck, the rope burn, the hair ... the slurred mouth in one painting appearing nearly natural elsewhere\"); the two paintings of Andreas Baader dead on the floor of his cell, head similarly in profile; the large slurred canvas of the crowds at the funeral, the three pale coffins hoisted on shoulders, passing through them. She has taken to returning day after day to interrogate the \"ashy blur\" of the grey-toned paintings based on the found photographs in police files and tabloids, and to immerse herself in the wintry but apparently consoling light emanating from their surfaces, enjoying a transcendent experience of the kind Mark Rothko liked to report people had in front of his paintings, and that pilgrims still travel to the Matisse chapel in Vence, for example, or the Rothko chapel in Houston to share. \"The people who weep before my pictures,\" Rothko remarked, \"are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them.\" That people cried when confronted with his pictures proved to him that he was communicating basic human emotions. \"It was a cross. She saw it as a cross,\" DeLillo writes in \"Looking at Meinhof\", \"and it made her feel, right or wrong, that there was an element of forgiveness in the picture, that the two men and the woman, terrorists ... were not beyond forgiveness.\"Gerhard Richter is not a believer. In anything. \"I believe in nothing\" is the most famous thing he has said, his equivalent of Warhol's \"I want to be a machine\" and belief that \"everybody should be like everybody\". (\"I want to be like everyone else, think what everyone else thinks, do what is being done anyway\": Richter, \"Notes\", 1964.)\"I consider belief of every kind, from astrology to every elevated religion and all great ideologies, to be superfluous and mortally dangerous,\" Richter has said. \"We no longer need such things. We ought to work out different strategies against misery and injustice, war and catastrophes.\"Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter was a child in Nazi-era Germany: his mother's brother, Uncle Rudi (whose portrait he later painted), died a young Nazi officer, while Richter's mentally disabled aunt was imprisoned in a Hitler euthanasia camp. He fled the eastern bloc and \"the criminal 'idealism' of the Socialists\" for Dusseldorf a few months before the Berlin wall went up in August 1961. Art, he once wrote, \"has always been basically about agony, desperation and hopelessness\". The art world, by contrast, \"is entirely superficial. Openings, dealership, social game-playing: these have become the form of art. They have long since wholly or at least largely taken its place.\" \"Thirteen years under National Socialism. Sixteen years under East German Communism,\" reads his official biography. Followed, it might add, by nearly half a century of what Richter has many times (supposedly jokingly) called \"Capitalist Realism\" in the west. Although the new paintings he is showing from next week at London's Serpentine Gallery grew out of the magisterial, geometrically patterned stained-glass window he designed for the south transept of Cologne cathedral, unveiled in August last year, the atmosphere Richter's paintings evoke is not one normally conducive to transporting the viewer to a spiritual realm. He seems temperamentally better suited to the secure courthouse purpose-built for the trial of the Baader-Meinhof group in a field a few hundred yards from Stammheim prison in a suburb of Stuttgart in the mid-70s. The single-storey building was surrounded by high steel fences and floodlit at night, and armed policemen patrolled it with guard dogs. \"Inside the windowless, artificially lit, technologically well-equipped, utilitarian and atmospherically space-age courtroom,\" Jillian Becker writes in her book Hitler's Children, \"the prisoners sat in a row ... dressed in similar blue jeans and loose black sweaters, thin from their hunger strikes and with prison pallor on their faces.\" It is an emotional climate - wan, dejected, sinister and slightly cruel - reproduced in the work of a whole generation of younger European artists who might reasonably be thought of as Richter's children, pre-eminently Luc Tuymans, Marlene Dumas and Gregor Schneider.Richter began doing social realism in East Germany; then, when he came to the west, was immediately taken up by the onslaught of pop art from America. This set him at odds with Georg Baselitz, his close contemporary and fellow fugitive from the GDR, who denounced and denied both mass culture and photography, which for many years formed the basis of Richter's art. From the outset, Richter painted what his website describes as \"images without glory\"; images that rendered the ridiculous, ordinary; the tragic, ordinary; the beautiful, ordinary. \"Many amateur photographs,\" he once said. \"are more beautiful than a Cézanne.\" Under the general heading \"Photo paintings\", click on any category - C includes Candles, Cars, Clouds, Corrugated Iron, Curtains; D begins with Death - and you are presented with images of insolent dumbness and puzzling neutrality. The subcategory \"Everyday Life\" brings up paintings called Pedestrians, Working in the Garden, Man on the Phone. Under \"Buildings\", we get Small Car Park, Small Church, Grey House, Corridor. Under \"Household Icons\", Kitchen Chair, Pillow Picture, Toilet Paper (many versions of the same, nearly used-up roll of prison-issue Izal). It is almost as if, in these modest, mostly black-and-white paintings, Richter has stumbled across cheap images more or less accidentally and then spent a week or more translating them into paint. Which is roughly what happened. Throughout his career he has shown a distrust of intention. He has consistently refused the idea of the \"masterpiece\" or \"inspiration\", and preferred instead to rely on ready-mades and chance. The images in the paintings are almost without exception based on pictures torn from newspapers and magazines, or snaps taken with an inexpensive camera. They are further impoverished or distorted by being made to appear blurred or bleached or ham-fistedly under-exposed. \"I hate the dazzlement of skill,\" Richter wrote as a young man of 32, in 1964. \"For example, being able to draw something freehand from life, or - even worse - inventing or putting together something entirely original: a particular form, a particular composition or an eccentric colour scheme ... I want to leave everything as it is. I therefore neither plan nor invent; I add nothing and omit nothing ... Being able to do something is never an adequate reason for doing it.\" In the 1970s, in apparent contradiction of his younger self, Richter began to use colour (\"Black-and-white was starting to get too aesthetic\") and to turn his hand to abstract painting. But this was gestural abstraction in the manner of the abstract expressionists, with all the performative carpet-chewing and messy existential angst cleanly and clinically removed. In his 2003 Mellon lectures, the former chief curator of painting at MoMA, Kirk Varnedoe, described Richter as \"a part-time abstractionist\" (a category in which he also placed Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly). Before the second world war, Varnedoe said, abstraction was an endpoint. It was something you arrived at after you had tried everything else. It was the absolute. For Richter, far from being an end-of-the-line distillation, abstract art was one option among many, to be picked up and put away again as he chose. \"Richter is not a painter of clarification,\" Varnedoe said, \"but a painter of doubt, one who constantly lives with 'yes, but'. Like Warhol, he is involved simultaneously with representation and the nagging ghost of abstraction. But unlike Warhol, he works into abstraction from the inside, as an absolute abstract painter, and shuttles between a form of photographic realism and a form of abstraction.\" The pictures' \"heartlessness about their mechanical nature\" made them very difficult to love. There was \"something acidulous and chilling\" about Richter's colours. What his abstractions and his trademark blurry, photo-figurative paintings had in common was \"the cool, deadpan, noncommittal nature of the engagement with the subject and the distance from the subject\". So different from the old abstract expressionists' crusty ideals of sincerity and good faith. Part of Richter's attraction for younger artists has been his refusal to accept that success means having a style. But Damien Hirst, a longtime admirer of Richter's, believes the \"skin\" of the pictures is what makes them identifiably \"Richters\"; that his work has always and only ever been about what Richter himself has called \"the smooth, equalising surface\". \"The subject matter is secondary,\" Hirst says. \"The unifying thing is the surface. The real care has gone into the surface of every painting. Photographs don't have a surface. It's what makes them different from paintings. It's what painting has left. It's like Richter takes a rippling, moving, delicate surface and hangs the image on top of it. It could have been rolled on in one sheet. They're like sweets or chocolate. They melt.\"Hirst is an artist who owes a debt to the colour side of Richter's practice. He has always been happy to acknowledge this. In the mid-60s, Richter started making paintings which reproduced the kind of colour sample charts that can be picked up in any hardware shop. What he was interested in was their smooth perfection and the precision in the reproduction of the colours, with the minimum of composition. They were sober, impartial and anonymous. Hirst saw reproductions of Richter's big, billboard-sized colour-chart paintings as a student, and many years later was prompted to adopt the same strategies of randomness, seriality and a gridded layout with his spot paintings, a raft of which was going under the hammer at Sotheby's as we spoke last Monday. Chatting about Richter was a kind of displacement activity. Richter's works also sell in the high millions. Hirst is far from alone in considering him to be among the world's greatest living painters.Hirst has commented in the past that the spot paintings could be what art looks like viewed through an imaginary microscope: \"A scientific approach to painting like the drug companies' scientific approach to life.\" Writing in the catalogue that accompanies 4900 Colours at the Serpentine, Birgit Pelzer remarks of Richter's work that \"the painted colour charts attempted to be as far away as possible from the emotive and sublime, from expression and lyricism. They aimed to take art to the edge of its own destruction.\" For several years, Richter painted the commercial colour cards as found, complete with white grid between the rectangles of colour, only on a grand scale. Sometime in the 70s he introduced chance and random selection into the composition; colours were numbered, and the numbers pulled out of a hat. Eventually, the separating margins were allowed to disappear, and raw colour freed to rub up against raw colour. The effect this produced unintentionally mimicked another photographic effect: that of pixelation - electronic blurring - except that digital hadn't been invented yet. \"Bright, vulgar, modern colours,\" as David Batchelor has written, \"in bright, vulgar, modern collisions with other bright, vulgar, modern colours.\" In his book Chromophobia, Batchelor makes the distinction between what he calls \"digital colour\" (commercial paints that come out of a tin) and \"analogical colour\" (artists' paints that come out of a tube). \"Analogical colour is a continuum, a seamless spectrum ... a merging of one colour into another. Digital colour is individuated; it comes in discrete units; there is no mergence or modulation; there are only boundaries, steps and edges.\"The postwar period brought the digitalisation of colour in art. This, Batchelor argues persuasively, \"was an entirely new conception of colour: more urban colours than the colours of nature. Artificial colours, city colours, industrial colours. Colours that are consistent with the images, materials and forms of an urban, industrial art.\"In August 2007, the city of Cologne unveiled Richter's startling new window for the south transept of Cologne cathedral. The original window had been destroyed during the second world war and replaced with clear glazing in 1948. Nearly 60 years later, Richter elected to fill in the sections of Gothic tracery with thousands of gridded, vibrantly coloured squares which suggested that the early, stained-glass images of Magi and saints had been pushed through a processor to the point of hyperchromatic digital breakdown. The seemingly arbitrary distribution of colours at Cologne was generated using a specially developed computer programme, and his renewed interest in using chance to determine composition led Richter to develop the idea for 4900 Colours at the Serpentine.In this most recent work, acrylic chips are chosen at random, spray-painted, and glued to an aluminium sheet. \"The random programme presents an instantaneous and apparently countless collection of coloured groupings,\" the catalogue explains, adopting the tones of a public-service announcement. \"The computer executes instructions without conscience or discernment, without intuition or will, without feelings or inductive thought. We are in the finite and infinite universe of numbers where the calculation process is transformed into a production role.\" All human agency has been removed. Why would a painter present a series of 49 identically sized, identically gridded panels made of industrially manufactured paint chips and present them as a single exhibition? As long ago as 1966, Richter wrote: \"I steer clear of definitions. I don't know what I want. I am inconsistent, noncommittal, passive; I like the indefinite, the boundless; I like continual uncertainty. Other qualities may be conducive to achievement, publicity, success; but they are all outworn - as outworn as ideologies, opinions, concepts and names for things.\" He added: \"Now that there are no priests or philosophers left, artists are the most important people in the world. This is the only thing that interests me.\"· Gerhard Richter's 4900 Colours: Version II is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2, from September 23 to November 16.

Like Warhol, he is involved simultaneously with representation and the nagging ghost of abstraction. But unlike Warhol, he works into abstraction from the inside, as an absolute abstract painter, and shuttles between a form of photographic realism and a form of abstraction.\" The pictures' \"heartlessness about their mechanical nature\" made them very difficult to love. There was \"something acidulous and chilling\" about Richter's colours. What his abstractions and his trademark blurry, photo-figurative paintings had in common was \"the cool, deadpan, noncommittal nature of the engagement with the subject and the distance from the subject\". So different from the old abstract expressionists' crusty ideals of sincerity and good faith. Part of Richter's attraction for younger artists has been his refusal to accept that success means having a style. But Damien Hirst, a longtime admirer of Richter's, believes the \"skin\" of the pictures is what makes them identifiably \"Richters\"; that his work has always and only ever been about what Richter himself has called \"the smooth, equalising surface\". \"The subject matter is secondary,\" Hirst says. \"The unifying thing is the surface. The real care has gone into the surface of every painting. Photographs don't have a surface. It's what makes them different from paintings. It's what painting has left. It's like Richter takes a rippling, moving, delicate surface and hangs the image on top of it. It could have been rolled on in one sheet. They're like sweets or chocolate. They melt.\"Hirst is an artist who owes a debt to the colour side of Richter's practice. He has always been happy to acknowledge this. In the mid-60s, Richter started making paintings which reproduced the kind of colour sample charts that can be picked up in any hardware shop. What he was interested in was their smooth perfection and the precision in the reproduction of the colours, with the minimum of composition. They were sober, impartial and anonymous. Hirst saw reproductions of Richter's big, billboard-sized colour-chart paintings as a student, and many years later was prompted to adopt the same strategies of randomness, seriality and a gridded layout with his spot paintings, a raft of which was going under the hammer at Sotheby's as we spoke last Monday. Chatting about Richter was a kind of displacement activity. Richter's works also sell in the high millions. Hirst is far from alone in considering him to be among the world's greatest living painters.Hirst has commented in the past that the spot paintings could be what art looks like viewed through an imaginary microscope: \"A scientific approach to painting like the drug companies' scientific approach to life.\" Writing in the catalogue that accompanies 4900 Colours at the Serpentine, Birgit Pelzer remarks of Richter's work that \"the painted colour charts attempted to be as far away as possible from the emotive and sublime, from expression and lyricism. They aimed to take art to the edge of its own destruction.\" For several years, Richter painted the commercial colour cards as found, complete with white grid between the rectangles of colour, only on a grand scale. Sometime in the 70s he introduced chance and random selection into the composition; colours were numbered, and the numbers pulled out of a hat. Eventually, the separating margins were allowed to disappear, and raw colour freed to rub up against raw colour. The effect this produced unintentionally mimicked another photographic effect: that of pixelation - electronic blurring - except that digital hadn't been invented yet. \"Bright, vulgar, modern colours,\" as David Batchelor has written, \"in bright, vulgar, modern collisions with other bright, vulgar, modern colours.\" In his book Chromophobia, Batchelor makes the distinction between what he calls \"digital colour\" (commercial paints that come out of a tin) and \"analogical colour\" (artists' paints that come out of a tube). \"Analogical colour is a continuum, a seamless spectrum ... a merging of one colour into another. Digital colour is individuated; it comes in discrete units; there is no mergence or modulation; there are only boundaries, steps and edges.\"The postwar period brought the digitalisation of colour in art. This, Batchelor argues persuasively, \"was an entirely new conception of colour: more urban colours than the colours of nature. Artificial colours, city colours, industrial colours. Colours that are consistent with the images, materials and forms of an urban, industrial art.\"In August 2007, the city of Cologne unveiled Richter's startling new window for the south transept of Cologne cathedral. The original window had been destroyed during the second world war and replaced with clear glazing in 1948. Nearly 60 years later, Richter elected to fill in the sections of Gothic tracery with thousands of gridded, vibrantly coloured squares which suggested that the early, stained-glass images of Magi and saints had been pushed through a processor to the point of hyperchromatic digital breakdown. The seemingly arbitrary distribution of colours at Cologne was generated using a specially developed computer programme, and his renewed interest in using chance to determine composition led Richter to develop the idea for 4900 Colours at the Serpentine.In this most recent work, acrylic chips are chosen at random, spray-painted, and glued to an aluminium sheet. \"The random programme presents an instantaneous and apparently countless collection of coloured groupings,\" the catalogue explains, adopting the tones of a public-service announcement. \"The computer executes instructions without conscience or discernment, without intuition or will, without feelings or inductive thought. We are in the finite and infinite universe of numbers where the calculation process is transformed into a production role.\" All human agency has been removed. Why would a painter present a series of 49 identically sized, identically gridded panels made of industrially manufactured paint chips and present them as a single exhibition? As long ago as 1966, Richter wrote: \"I steer clear of definitions. I don't know what I want. I am inconsistent, noncommittal, passive; I like the indefinite, the boundless; I like continual uncertainty. Other qualities may be conducive to achievement, publicity, success; but they are all outworn - as outworn as ideologies, opinions, concepts and names for things.\" He added: \"Now that there are no priests or philosophers left, artists are the most important people in the world. This is the only thing that interests me.\"· Gerhard Richter's 4900 Colours: Version II is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2, from September 23 to November 16. Details: 020 7402 6075; serpentinegallery.org· This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. An editing slip meant we located the Rosary chapel, which Matisse designed and decorated, in Venice. It is in Vence, southern France. This has been corrected.Don DeLillo's bleak short story \"Looking at Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The meeting takes place in the room displaying October 18, 1977 (1988), Gerhard Richter's remarkable suite of 15 canvases ruminating on the alleged suicide/death/police murder of Andreas Baader and other members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in a German prison in 1977. The man in the story, it transpires, is killing time between job interviews. The woman, though, is in thrall to the cycle of paintings.\"I realise now that the first day I was only barely looking. I thought I was looking, but I was only getting a bare inkling of what's in these paintings. I'm only just starting to look ... I think I feel helpless. These paintings make me feel how helpless a person can be.\"She has developed an obsession with the multiple images of Ulrike Meinhof dead in her cell (\"the head, the neck, the rope burn, the hair ... the slurred mouth in one painting appearing nearly natural elsewhere\"); the two paintings of Andreas Baader dead on the floor of his cell, head similarly in profile; the large slurred canvas of the crowds at the funeral, the three pale coffins hoisted on shoulders, passing through them. She has taken to returning day after day to interrogate the \"ashy blur\" of the grey-toned paintings based on the found photographs in police files and tabloids, and to immerse herself in the wintry but apparently consoling light emanating from their surfaces, enjoying a transcendent experience of the kind Mark Rothko liked to report people had in front of his paintings, and that pilgrims still travel to the Matisse chapel in Vence, for example, or the Rothko chapel in Houston to share. \"The people who weep before my pictures,\" Rothko remarked, \"are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them.\" That people cried when confronted with his pictures proved to him that he was communicating basic human emotions. \"It was a cross. She saw it as a cross,\" DeLillo writes in \"Looking at Meinhof\", \"and it made her feel, right or wrong, that there was an element of forgiveness in the picture, that the two men and the woman, terrorists ... were not beyond forgiveness.\"Gerhard Richter is not a believer. In anything. \"I believe in nothing\" is the most famous thing he has said, his equivalent of Warhol's \"I want to be a machine\" and belief that \"everybody should be like everybody\". (\"I want to be like everyone else, think what everyone else thinks, do what is being done anyway\": Richter, \"Notes\", 1964.)\"I consider belief of every kind, from astrology to every elevated religion and all great ideologies, to be superfluous and mortally dangerous,\" Richter has said. \"We no longer need such things. We ought to work out different strategies against misery and injustice, war and catastrophes.\"Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter was a child in Nazi-era Germany: his mother's brother, Uncle Rudi (whose portrait he later painted), died a young Nazi officer, while Richter's mentally disabled aunt was imprisoned in a Hitler euthanasia camp. He fled the eastern bloc and \"the criminal 'idealism' of the Socialists\" for Dusseldorf a few months before the Berlin wall went up in August 1961. Art, he once wrote, \"has always been basically about agony, desperation and hopelessness\". The art world, by contrast, \"is entirely superficial. Openings, dealership, social game-playing: these have become the form of art. They have long since wholly or at least largely taken its place.\" \"Thirteen years under National Socialism. Sixteen years under East German Communism,\" reads his official biography. Followed, it might add, by nearly half a century of what Richter has many times (supposedly jokingly) called \"Capitalist Realism\" in the west. Although the new paintings he is showing from next week at London's Serpentine Gallery grew out of the magisterial, geometrically patterned stained-glass window he designed for the south transept of Cologne cathedral, unveiled in August last year, the atmosphere Richter's paintings evoke is not one normally conducive to transporting the viewer to a spiritual realm. He seems temperamentally better suited to the secure courthouse purpose-built for the trial of the Baader-Meinhof group in a field a few hundred yards from Stammheim prison in a suburb of Stuttgart in the mid-70s. The single-storey building was surrounded by high steel fences and floodlit at night, and armed policemen patrolled it with guard dogs. \"Inside the windowless, artificially lit, technologically well-equipped, utilitarian and atmospherically space-age courtroom,\" Jillian Becker writes in her book Hitler's Children, \"the prisoners sat in a row ... dressed in similar blue jeans and loose black sweaters, thin from their hunger strikes and with prison pallor on their faces.\" It is an emotional climate - wan, dejected, sinister and slightly cruel - reproduced in the work of a whole generation of younger European artists who might reasonably be thought of as Richter's children, pre-eminently Luc Tuymans, Marlene Dumas and Gregor Schneider.Richter began doing social realism in East Germany; then, when he came to the west, was immediately taken up by the onslaught of pop art from America. This set him at odds with Georg Baselitz, his close contemporary and fellow fugitive from the GDR, who denounced and denied both mass culture and photography, which for many years formed the basis of Richter's art. From the outset, Richter painted what his website describes as \"images without glory\"; images that rendered the ridiculous, ordinary; the tragic, ordinary; the beautiful, ordinary. \"Many amateur photographs,\" he once said. \"are more beautiful than a Cézanne.\" Under the general heading \"Photo paintings\", click on any category - C includes Candles, Cars, Clouds, Corrugated Iron, Curtains; D begins with Death - and you are presented with images of insolent dumbness and puzzling neutrality. The subcategory \"Everyday Life\" brings up paintings called Pedestrians, Working in the Garden, Man on the Phone. Under \"Buildings\", we get Small Car Park, Small Church, Grey House, Corridor. Under \"Household Icons\", Kitchen Chair, Pillow Picture, Toilet Paper (many versions of the same, nearly used-up roll of prison-issue Izal). It is almost as if, in these modest, mostly black-and-white paintings, Richter has stumbled across cheap images more or less accidentally and then spent a week or more translating them into paint. Which is roughly what happened. Throughout his career he has shown a distrust of intention. He has consistently refused the idea of the \"masterpiece\" or \"inspiration\", and preferred instead to rely on ready-mades and chance. The images in the paintings are almost without exception based on pictures torn from newspapers and magazines, or snaps taken with an inexpensive camera. They are further impoverished or distorted by being made to appear blurred or bleached or ham-fistedly under-exposed. \"I hate the dazzlement of skill,\" Richter wrote as a young man of 32, in 1964. \"For example, being able to draw something freehand from life, or - even worse - inventing or putting together something entirely original: a particular form, a particular composition or an eccentric colour scheme ... I want to leave everything as it is. I therefore neither plan nor invent; I add nothing and omit nothing ... Being able to do something is never an adequate reason for doing it.\" In the 1970s, in apparent contradiction of his younger self, Richter began to use colour (\"Black-and-white was starting to get too aesthetic\") and to turn his hand to abstract painting. But this was gestural abstraction in the manner of the abstract expressionists, with all the performative carpet-chewing and messy existential angst cleanly and clinically removed. In his 2003 Mellon lectures, the former chief curator of painting at MoMA, Kirk Varnedoe, described Richter as \"a part-time abstractionist\" (a category in which he also placed Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly). Before the second world war, Varnedoe said, abstraction was an endpoint. It was something you arrived at after you had tried everything else. It was the absolute. For Richter, far from being an end-of-the-line distillation, abstract art was one option among many, to be picked up and put away again as he chose. \"Richter is not a painter of clarification,\" Varnedoe said, \"but a painter of doubt, one who constantly lives with 'yes, but'.

Why would a painter present a series of 49 identically sized, identically gridded panels made of industrially manufactured paint chips and present them as a single exhibition? As long ago as 1966, Richter wrote: \"I steer clear of definitions. I don't know what I want. I am inconsistent, noncommittal, passive; I like the indefinite, the boundless; I like continual uncertainty. Other qualities may be conducive to achievement, publicity, success; but they are all outworn - as outworn as ideologies, opinions, concepts and names for things.\" He added: \"Now that there are no priests or philosophers left, artists are the most important people in the world. This is the only thing that interests me.\"· Gerhard Richter's 4900 Colours: Version II is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2, from September 23 to November 16. Details: 020 7402 6075; serpentinegallery.org· This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. An editing slip meant we located the Rosary chapel, which Matisse designed and decorated, in Venice. It is in Vence, southern France. This has been corrected.Don DeLillo's bleak short story \"Looking at Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The meeting takes place in the room displaying October 18, 1977 (1988), Gerhard Richter's remarkable suite of 15 canvases ruminating on the alleged suicide/death/police murder of Andreas Baader and other members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in a German prison in 1977. The man in the story, it transpires, is killing time between job interviews. The woman, though, is in thrall to the cycle of paintings.DDArt\"I realise now that the first day I was only barely looking. I thought I was looking, but I was only getting a bare inkling of what's in these paintings. I'm only just starting to look ... I think I feel helpless. These paintings make me feel how helpless a person can be.\"She has developed an obsession with the multiple images of Ulrike Meinhof dead in her cell (\"the head, the neck, the rope burn, the hair ... the slurred mouth in one painting appearing nearly natural elsewhere\"); the two paintings of Andreas Baader dead on the floor of his cell, head similarly in profile; the large slurred canvas of the crowds at the funeral, the three pale coffins hoisted on shoulders, passing through them. She has taken to returning day after day to interrogate the \"ashy blur\" of the grey-toned paintings based on the found photographs in police files and tabloids, and to immerse herself in the wintry but apparently consoling light emanating from their surfaces, enjoying a transcendent experience of the kind Mark Rothko liked to report people had in front of his paintings, and that pilgrims still travel to the Matisse chapel in Vence, for example, or the Rothko chapel in Houston to share. \"The people who weep before my pictures,\" Rothko remarked, \"are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them.\" That people cried when confronted with his pictures proved to him that he was communicating basic human emotions. \"It was a cross. She saw it as a cross,\" DeLillo writes in \"Looking at Meinhof\", \"and it made her feel, right or wrong, that there was an element of forgiveness in the picture, that the two men and the woman, terrorists ... were not beyond forgiveness.\"Gerhard Richter is not a believer. In anything. \"I believe in nothing\" is the most famous thing he has said, his equivalent of Warhol's \"I want to be a machine\" and belief that \"everybody should be like everybody\". (\"I want to be like everyone else, think what everyone else thinks, do what is being done anyway\": Richter, \"Notes\", 1964.)Gerhard Richter\"I consider belief of every kind, from astrology to every elevated religion and all great ideologies, to be superfluous and mortally dangerous,\" Richter has said. \"We no longer need such things. We ought to work out different strategies against misery and injustice, war and catastrophes.\"Born in 1932 in Dresden, Richter was a child in Nazi-era Germany: his mother's brother, Uncle Rudi (whose portrait he later painted), died a young Nazi officer, while Richter's mentally disabled aunt was imprisoned in a Hitler euthanasia camp. He fled the eastern bloc and \"the criminal 'idealism' of the Socialists\" for Dusseldorf a few months before the Berlin wall went up in August 1961. Art, he once wrote, \"has always been basically about agony, desperation and hopelessness\". The art world, by contrast, \"is entirely superficial. Openings, dealership, social game-playing: these have become the form of art. They have long since wholly or at least largely taken its place.\" \"Thirteen years under National Socialism. Sixteen years under East German Communism,\" reads his official biography. Followed, it might add, by nearly half a century of what Richter has many times (supposedly jokingly) called \"Capitalist Realism\" in the west. Although the new paintings he is showing from next week at London's Serpentine Gallery grew out of the magisterial, geometrically patterned stained-glass window he designed for the south transept of Cologne cathedral, unveiled in August last year, the atmosphere Richter's paintings evoke is not one normally conducive to transporting the viewer to a spiritual realm. He seems temperamentally better suited to the secure courthouse purpose-built for the trial of the Baader-Meinhof group in a field a few hundred yards from Stammheim prison in a suburb of Stuttgart in the mid-70s. The single-storey building was surrounded by high steel fences and floodlit at night, and armed policemen patrolled it with guard dogs. \"Inside the windowless, artificially lit, technologically well-equipped, utilitarian and atmospherically space-age courtroom,\" Jillian Becker writes in her book Hitler's Children, \"the prisoners sat in a row ... dressed in similar blue jeans and loose black sweaters, thin from their hunger strikes and with prison pallor on their faces.\" It is an emotional climate - wan, dejected, sinister and slightly cruel - reproduced in the work of a whole generation of younger European artists who might reasonably be thought of as Richter's children, pre-eminently Luc Tuymans, Marlene Dumas and Gregor Schneider.Richter began doing social realism in East Germany; then, when he came to the west, was immediately taken up by the onslaught of pop art from America. This set him at odds with Georg Baselitz, his close contemporary and fellow fugitive from the GDR, who denounced and denied both mass culture and photography, which for many years formed the basis of Richter's art. From the outset, Richter painted what his website describes as \"images without glory\"; images that rendered the ridiculous, ordinary; the tragic, ordinary; the beautiful, ordinary. \"Many amateur photographs,\" he once said. \"are more beautiful than a Cézanne.\" Under the general heading \"Photo paintings\", click on any category - C includes Candles, Cars, Clouds, Corrugated Iron, Curtains; D begins with Death - and you are presented with images of insolent dumbness and puzzling neutrality. The subcategory \"Everyday Life\" brings up paintings called Pedestrians, Working in the Garden, Man on the Phone. Under \"Buildings\", we get Small Car Park, Small Church, Grey House, Corridor. Under \"Household Icons\", Kitchen Chair, Pillow Picture, Toilet Paper (many versions of the same, nearly used-up roll of prison-issue Izal). It is almost as if, in these modest, mostly black-and-white paintings, Richter has stumbled across cheap images more or less accidentally and then spent a week or more translating them into paint. Which is roughly what happened. Throughout his career he has shown a distrust of intention. He has consistently refused the idea of the \"masterpiece\" or \"inspiration\", and preferred instead to rely on ready-mades and chance. The images in the paintings are almost without exception based on pictures torn from newspapers and magazines, or snaps taken with an inexpensive camera. They are further impoverished or distorted by being made to appear blurred or bleached or ham-fistedly under-exposed. \"I hate the dazzlement of skill,\" Richter wrote as a young man of 32, in 1964. \"For example, being able to draw something freehand from life, or - even worse - inventing or putting together something entirely original: a particular form, a particular composition or an eccentric colour scheme ... I want to leave everything as it is. I therefore neither plan nor invent; I add nothing and omit nothing ... Being able to do something is never an adequate reason for doing it.\" In the 1970s, in apparent contradiction of his younger self, Richter began to use colour (\"Black-and-white was starting to get too aesthetic\") and to turn his hand to abstract painting. But this was gestural abstraction in the manner of the abstract expressionists, with all the performative carpet-chewing and messy existential angst cleanly and clinically removed. In his 2003 Mellon lectures, the former chief curator of painting at MoMA, Kirk Varnedoe, described Richter as \"a part-time abstractionist\" (a category in which he also placed Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly). Before the second world war, Varnedoe said, abstraction was an endpoint. It was something you arrived at after you had tried everything else. It was the absolute. For Richter, far from being an end-of-the-line distillation, abstract art was one option among many, to be picked up and put away again as he chose. \"Richter is not a painter of clarification,\" Varnedoe said, \"but a painter of doubt, one who constantly lives with 'yes, but'. Like Warhol, he is involved simultaneously with representation and the nagging ghost of abstraction. But unlike Warhol, he works into abstraction from the inside, as an absolute abstract painter, and shuttles between a form of photographic realism and a form of abstraction.\" The pictures' \"heartlessness about their mechanical nature\" made them very difficult to love. There was \"something acidulous and chilling\" about Richter's colours. What his abstractions and his trademark blurry, photo-figurative paintings had in common was \"the cool, deadpan, noncommittal nature of the engagement with the subject and the distance from the subject\". So different from the old abstract expressionists' crusty ideals of sincerity and good faith. Part of Richter's attraction for younger artists has been his refusal to accept that success means having a style. But Damien Hirst, a longtime admirer of Richter's, believes the \"skin\" of the pictures is what makes them identifiably \"Richters\"; that his work has always and only ever been about what Richter himself has called \"the smooth, equalising surface\". \"The subject matter is secondary,\" Hirst says. \"The unifying thing is the surface. The real care has gone into the surface of every painting. Photographs don't have a surface. It's what makes them different from paintings. It's what painting has left. It's like Richter takes a rippling, moving, delicate surface and hangs the image on top of it. It could have been rolled on in one sheet. They're like sweets or chocolate. They melt.\"Damien HirstHirst is an artist who owes a debt to the colour side of Richter's practice. He has always been happy to acknowledge this. In the mid-60s, Richter started making paintings which reproduced the kind of colour sample charts that can be picked up in any hardware shop. What he was interested in was their smooth perfection and the precision in the reproduction of the colours, with the minimum of composition. They were sober, impartial and anonymous. Hirst saw reproductions of Richter's big, billboard-sized colour-chart paintings as a student, and many years later was prompted to adopt the same strategies of randomness, seriality and a gridded layout with his spot paintings, a raft of which was going under the hammer at Sotheby's as we spoke last Monday. Chatting about Richter was a kind of displacement activity. Richter's works also sell in the high millions. Hirst is far from alone in considering him to be among the world's greatest living painters.Hirst has commented in the past that the spot paintings could be what art looks like viewed through an imaginary microscope: \"A scientific approach to painting like the drug companies' scientific approach to life.\" Writing in the catalogue that accompanies 4900 Colours at the Serpentine, Birgit Pelzer remarks of Richter's work that \"the painted colour charts attempted to be as far away as possible from the emotive and sublime, from expression and lyricism. They aimed to take art to the edge of its own destruction.\" For several years, Richter painted the commercial colour cards as found, complete with white grid between the rectangles of colour, only on a grand scale. Sometime in the 70s he introduced chance and random selection into the composition; colours were numbered, and the numbers pulled out of a hat. Eventually, the separating margins were allowed to disappear, and raw colour freed to rub up against raw colour. The effect this produced unintentionally mimicked another photographic effect: that of pixelation - electronic blurring - except that digital hadn't been invented yet. \"Bright, vulgar, modern colours,\" as David Batchelor has written, \"in bright, vulgar, modern collisions with other bright, vulgar, modern colours.\" In his book Chromophobia, Batchelor makes the distinction between what he calls \"digital colour\" (commercial paints that come out of a tin) and \"analogical colour\" (artists' paints that come out of a tube). \"Analogical colour is a continuum, a seamless spectrum ... a merging of one colour into another. Digital colour is individuated; it comes in discrete units; there is no mergence or modulation; there are only boundaries, steps and edges.\"The postwar period brought the digitalisation of colour in art. This, Batchelor argues persuasively, \"was an entirely new conception of colour: more urban colours than the colours of nature. Artificial colours, city colours, industrial colours. Colours that are consistent with the images, materials and forms of an urban, industrial art.\"In August 2007, the city of Cologne unveiled Richter's startling new window for the south transept of Cologne cathedral. The original window had been destroyed during the second world war and replaced with clear glazing in 1948. Nearly 60 years later, Richter elected to fill in the sections of Gothic tracery with thousands of gridded, vibrantly coloured squares which suggested that the early, stained-glass images of Magi and saints had been pushed through a processor to the point of hyperchromatic digital breakdown. The seemingly arbitrary distribution of colours at Cologne was generated using a specially developed computer programme, and his renewed interest in using chance to determine composition led Richter to develop the idea for 4900 Colours at the Serpentine.In this most recent work, acrylic chips are chosen at random, spray-painted, and glued to an aluminium sheet. \"The random programme presents an instantaneous and apparently countless collection of coloured groupings,\" the catalogue explains, adopting the tones of a public-service announcement. \"The computer executes instructions without conscience or discernment, without intuition or will, without feelings or inductive thought. We are in the finite and infinite universe of numbers where the calculation process is transformed into a production role.\" All human agency has been removed. Why would a painter present a series of 49 identically sized, identically gridded panels made of industrially manufactured paint chips and present them as a single exhibition?

        "text": "Walking through Panorama, Tate Modern's Gerhard Richter retrospective, is like turning the dial on an old radio. Things erupt from the static as you swim between stations. Suddenly there is a voice, a garbled news broadcast, a shrill single tone, a story being told, music, then silence. Little wonder Richter admires John Cage; following Cage's dictum, Richter is a painter who professes to have nothing to say, then says it.Whenever you think of Richter as one kind of artist, he turns out to be another. However bewildering this can be, there is a consistent tone of voice, whatever his subjects. It is something much more than style: here's a skull, some morbid candles, a flayed abstraction; how about some white fluffy clouds, isolated in their painted skies? At 80, Richter still surprises me. His continuing inventiveness and constant doubt, the variety and stern pleasures of his work give me a bleak sort of hope. This is hard to explain. I do not know what that hope entails.The present exhibition is more than a blow-by-blow account of Richter's development since 1961, when the artist, by then a successful young mural painter, crossed from East Germany to the west and re-embarked on a career full of interesting confusions, cross-currents, contradictions and detours. The exhibition makes a kind of cumulative sense. (The longer Richter works, the more sense his art makes.)Recently, an old friend in Dresden rediscovered some monoprints Richter left behind when he departed for the west. The work of an afternoon or two, these prints seem to prefigure what followed, with their rollered ink fields, blobs and full moons, little figures, indeterminate greys where the ink ran out.Curated by Nicholas Serota and Mark Godfrey, this show sets up all sorts of telling juxtapositions, while following the thread not just of Richter's thinking, but of history – and in particular German history – since the second world war. We go from the saturation bombing of Dresden and Cologne to 1960s West German consumerism, from 1970s domestic terrorism to 9/11. There are paintings devoted to Richter's parents, his aunts and uncles, and what happened to them in wartime. There are paintings devoted to his children, and to becoming a father again in his 60s. He confronts the personal with the public, one kind of history with another.Often Richter's paintings are based on photographs: his father Horst, moon-faced with jutting-out hair, cradling a dog; smiling Aunt Marianne with the infant Gerhard, looking less than happy. Richter's maternal aunt was mentally ill, eventually institutionalised, and killed in the Nazi's eugenics programme. Here's Uncle Rudi, the grinning soldier in his great coat, dead in the first days of the war. On another wall, in glowing colour, a group of Nubians, whose image comes from a Leni Riefenstahl photograph. And there two couples, almost naked, enjoy the freedoms of the permissive age. My God, I think, looking from picture to picture, how the world turns. Almost the first thing you see in the show is a painting of a man crushed to death by a great block of stone. Tote, it says on the canvas: dead. Images and symbols of death keep coming back, even in the blankness of Richter's most mute abstractions.That's one way of telling the story. His art also reflects his encounters with other artists: Joseph Beuys, a side-on painting of an old chair, like the one Beuys sat a wedge of fat upon; and Marcel Duchamp, a painting of Richter's first wife, naked, walking downstairs, in memory of Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase. Nearby hangs a little grisaille study of a roll of toilet paper dangling on a wall, a distant joking recall of Duchamp's urinal. Why not a bog roll? It has a dumb kind of everyday presence, as much as Manet's sticks of asparagus or Chardin's cloves of garlic. It hangs there, waiting, with as much or as little dignity as anything else. Richter sees it with a careful, affectless eye.A tourist eaten by a lionCaspar David Friedrich's German Romanticism, Titian's Venetian colour, constructivism and postwar gestural painting, minimalism and process art are all grist to Richter's mill. His 1973 Annunciation After Titian is a reworking from a postcard of the original, while the impossibility of Friedrich's Romanticism returns time and again in Richter's seascapes and his Greenland photographs. \"I was always looking,\" he once said, \"for a third way, in which eastern realism and western modernism would be resolved into one redeeming construct.\" If this remains Richter's programme, it is one riven with the irreconcilable, a friction on which his art depends.And let's not forget his photographs and sculptures, his clear and painted planes of glass, his mirrors and polished metal spheres, which also act as convex mirrors. In Richter's case, it is not a matter of doing this then that, or of choosing to be a landscape painter, or a photographer of icebergs in the mist, or a squeegee-wielding producer of giant, scaly abstracts. It's a case of making choices that don't exclude their opposites.Richter paints blurred scenes of violence: a tourist being eaten by a lion in a safari park, as well as harmonic colour grids. He is as capable of a tender painting of his daughter as of an impenetrable, sticky grey monochrome. His 1988 portrait of Betty, turned away from the viewer, is looking towards one of her father's sludgy monochromes, which becomes the portrait's background. We follow her gaze, too. It makes me think that certain paintings might well be seen as backgrounds, in front of which things pass. Richter is always thinking about the different degrees of attention we give to things from one moment to the next, things swimming in and out of view, hovering distantly. A broken smear of red welling up through a layer of greeny-blue paint inhabits the same discontinuous universe as a view down an alley to a cathedral wall, hit by sunlight.I almost wish this exhibition were larger; as it is, Panorama is probably as good a retrospective as we are likely to see, given the loans it is possible to get, and the fact that Richter is still working. It is unlikely that he will settle for a late grand manner, especially when he has so many manners to choose from. Richter himself might be surprised by what comes next, and by what it might mean for what came before.Will our children die horribly? You might wonder if Richter is indifferent towards his subjects or his manners of working (I can paint like this and I can paint like that, too, as if all things were equal), but this is evidently not the case. Speaking of his 1988 paintings based on the arrests, deaths and funerals of members of the Baader-Meinhof gang, Richter said: \"Ever since I have been able to think, I have known that every rule and opinion – insofar as either is ideologically motivated – is false, a hindrance, a menace, a crime.\" The entire series remains a deeply ambiguous venture, and that is its strength. More recently the artist told Serota, in an interview for the exhibition's catalogue: \"I don't even like showing them any more. The press love them. Dreadful!'\"Loving these 15 paintings is difficult, but it is impossible to ignore their significance (as enigmatic modern history paintings, which avoid a moral stance) and the fact that the events they portray took place in 1977, the same year he painted his first portrait of his daughter, Betty. Richter painted them in 1988, the year of his third portrait of his daughter, the one in which she turns away from the viewer, and by implication, from the painter himself. The questions about what will become of our children (Will they reject us? Will they see through us?) are unavoidable. Will they become terrorists and die horrible deaths, their names odious to the world? These are fears that might dog any parent, and particularly so in Germany, when so many remained silent about what happened in the 1930s and 40s. Richter's paintings wipe out the world then reinvent it, over and over, in all its awful complexity.Walking through Panorama, Tate Modern's Gerhard Richter retrospective, is like turning the dial on an old radio.

Little wonder Richter admires John Cage; following Cage's dictum, Richter is a painter who professes to have nothing to say, then says it.Whenever you think of Richter as one kind of artist, he turns out to be another. However bewildering this can be, there is a consistent tone of voice, whatever his subjects. It is something much more than style: here's a skull, some morbid candles, a flayed abstraction; how about some white fluffy clouds, isolated in their painted skies? At 80, Richter still surprises me. His continuing inventiveness and constant doubt, the variety and stern pleasures of his work give me a bleak sort of hope. This is hard to explain. I do not know what that hope entails.The present exhibition is more than a blow-by-blow account of Richter's development since 1961, when the artist, by then a successful young mural painter, crossed from East Germany to the west and re-embarked on a career full of interesting confusions, cross-currents, contradictions and detours. The exhibition makes a kind of cumulative sense. (The longer Richter works, the more sense his art makes.)Recently, an old friend in Dresden rediscovered some monoprints Richter left behind when he departed for the west. The work of an afternoon or two, these prints seem to prefigure what followed, with their rollered ink fields, blobs and full moons, little figures, indeterminate greys where the ink ran out.Curated by Nicholas Serota and Mark Godfrey, this show sets up all sorts of telling juxtapositions, while following the thread not just of Richter's thinking, but of history – and in particular German history – since the second world war. We go from the saturation bombing of Dresden and Cologne to 1960s West German consumerism, from 1970s domestic terrorism to 9/11. There are paintings devoted to Richter's parents, his aunts and uncles, and what happened to them in wartime. There are paintings devoted to his children, and to becoming a father again in his 60s. He confronts the personal with the public, one kind of history with another.Often Richter's paintings are based on photographs: his father Horst, moon-faced with jutting-out hair, cradling a dog; smiling Aunt Marianne with the infant Gerhard, looking less than happy. Richter's maternal aunt was mentally ill, eventually institutionalised, and killed in the Nazi's eugenics programme. Here's Uncle Rudi, the grinning soldier in his great coat, dead in the first days of the war. On another wall, in glowing colour, a group of Nubians, whose image comes from a Leni Riefenstahl photograph. And there two couples, almost naked, enjoy the freedoms of the permissive age. My God, I think, looking from picture to picture, how the world turns. Almost the first thing you see in the show is a painting of a man crushed to death by a great block of stone. Tote, it says on the canvas: dead. Images and symbols of death keep coming back, even in the blankness of Richter's most mute abstractions.That's one way of telling the story. His art also reflects his encounters with other artists: Joseph Beuys, a side-on painting of an old chair, like the one Beuys sat a wedge of fat upon; and Marcel Duchamp, a painting of Richter's first wife, naked, walking downstairs, in memory of Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase. Nearby hangs a little grisaille study of a roll of toilet paper dangling on a wall, a distant joking recall of Duchamp's urinal. Why not a bog roll? It has a dumb kind of everyday presence, as much as Manet's sticks of asparagus or Chardin's cloves of garlic. It hangs there, waiting, with as much or as little dignity as anything else. Richter sees it with a careful, affectless eye.A tourist eaten by a lionCaspar David Friedrich's German Romanticism, Titian's Venetian colour, constructivism and postwar gestural painting, minimalism and process art are all grist to Richter's mill. His 1973 Annunciation After Titian is a reworking from a postcard of the original, while the impossibility of Friedrich's Romanticism returns time and again in Richter's seascapes and his Greenland photographs. \"I was always looking,\" he once said, \"for a third way, in which eastern realism and western modernism would be resolved into one redeeming construct.\" If this remains Richter's programme, it is one riven with the irreconcilable, a friction on which his art depends.And let's not forget his photographs and sculptures, his clear and painted planes of glass, his mirrors and polished metal spheres, which also act as convex mirrors. In Richter's case, it is not a matter of doing this then that, or of choosing to be a landscape painter, or a photographer of icebergs in the mist, or a squeegee-wielding producer of giant, scaly abstracts. It's a case of making choices that don't exclude their opposites.Richter paints blurred scenes of violence: a tourist being eaten by a lion in a safari park, as well as harmonic colour grids. He is as capable of a tender painting of his daughter as of an impenetrable, sticky grey monochrome. His 1988 portrait of Betty, turned away from the viewer, is looking towards one of her father's sludgy monochromes, which becomes the portrait's background. We follow her gaze, too. It makes me think that certain paintings might well be seen as backgrounds, in front of which things pass. Richter is always thinking about the different degrees of attention we give to things from one moment to the next, things swimming in and out of view, hovering distantly. A broken smear of red welling up through a layer of greeny-blue paint inhabits the same discontinuous universe as a view down an alley to a cathedral wall, hit by sunlight.I almost wish this exhibition were larger; as it is, Panorama is probably as good a retrospective as we are likely to see, given the loans it is possible to get, and the fact that Richter is still working. It is unlikely that he will settle for a late grand manner, especially when he has so many manners to choose from. Richter himself might be surprised by what comes next, and by what it might mean for what came before.Will our children die horribly? You might wonder if Richter is indifferent towards his subjects or his manners of working (I can paint like this and I can paint like that, too, as if all things were equal), but this is evidently not the case. Speaking of his 1988 paintings based on the arrests, deaths and funerals of members of the Baader-Meinhof gang, Richter said: \"Ever since I have been able to think, I have known that every rule and opinion – insofar as either is ideologically motivated – is false, a hindrance, a menace, a crime.\" The entire series remains a deeply ambiguous venture, and that is its strength. More recently the artist told Serota, in an interview for the exhibition's catalogue: \"I don't even like showing them any more. The press love them. Dreadful!'\"Loving these 15 paintings is difficult, but it is impossible to ignore their significance (as enigmatic modern history paintings, which avoid a moral stance) and the fact that the events they portray took place in 1977, the same year he painted his first portrait of his daughter, Betty. Richter painted them in 1988, the year of his third portrait of his daughter, the one in which she turns away from the viewer, and by implication, from the painter himself. The questions about what will become of our children (Will they reject us? Will they see through us?) are unavoidable. Will they become terrorists and die horrible deaths, their names odious to the world? These are fears that might dog any parent, and particularly so in Germany, when so many remained silent about what happened in the 1930s and 40s.

Art experts said there was huge interest in the painting because it is not only one of Richter’s biggest works butalso one of his favourites.The canvas is the product of Richter’s careful build-up of paint, which is then pulled away with a piece of wood to produce a colourful, multi-layered image. Richter had personally asked that the painting go on extended loan to the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, during the 1990s.A Francis Bacon self-portrait also sold for £14.7m – 41 times more than the price it achieved the last time it appeared at auction in 1993.The painting, called Two Studies for Self-Portrait, was created at the height of Bacon’s career in 1977. Sotheby’s said an anonymous bidder had bought it for £14,709,000 in contrast to the £353,500 it reached when it was last auctioned in December 1993. It had a £13m-to-18m estimate. Sotheby’s described it as “an extremely rare example” of a series of “profoundly introspective” self-portraits Bacon completed after the suicide of his lover, George Dyer, in 1971. An art lover also paid a record £8,381,000 for Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1969) by Italian artist Lucio Fontana, whose style developed after he swapped the paintbrush for the razor-blade. The work contains 23 cuts. Sotheby’s said they had recorded “a series of strong prices” for British art from international collectors in the sale, titled Titans of Contemporary Art. David Hockney’s Green Tide (1989) sold for £2,165,000. Hockney created the work at his studio just outside Los Angeles and it had not been seen in public for a quarter of a century.

Richter had personally asked that the painting go on extended loan to the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, during the 1990s.A Francis Bacon self-portrait also sold for £14.7m – 41 times more than the price it achieved the last time it appeared at auction in 1993.The painting, called Two Studies for Self-Portrait, was created at the height of Bacon’s career in 1977. Sotheby’s said an anonymous bidder had bought it for £14,709,000 in contrast to the £353,500 it reached when it was last auctioned in December 1993. It had a £13m-to-18m estimate. Sotheby’s described it as “an extremely rare example” of a series of “profoundly introspective” self-portraits Bacon completed after the suicide of his lover, George Dyer, in 1971. An art lover also paid a record £8,381,000 for Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1969) by Italian artist Lucio Fontana, whose style developed after he swapped the paintbrush for the razor-blade. The work contains 23 cuts. Sotheby’s said they had recorded “a series of strong prices” for British art from international collectors in the sale, titled Titans of Contemporary Art. David Hockney’s Green Tide (1989) sold for £2,165,000. Hockney created the work at his studio just outside Los Angeles and it had not been seen in public for a quarter of a century.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.)

On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls.

(“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich. Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner GalleryThere promises to be little, if any, furor over Polke’s windows in Zurich, where feelings about the official religion are tepid—in a canton of 1.25 million people, the Grossmünster, its liberal-minded senior minister, Kathi La Roche, told me, has only about eleven hundred congregants. And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings.

My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.)

The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich. Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner GalleryThere promises to be little, if any, furor over Polke’s windows in Zurich, where feelings about the official religion are tepid—in a canton of 1.25 million people, the Grossmünster, its liberal-minded senior minister, Kathi La Roche, told me, has only about eleven hundred congregants. And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.)

On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls.

They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

(I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich. Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery Photographs by (left to right): © Gerhard Richter / Dombauarchiv KÖLn, Matz Und Schenk; Sigmar Polke / Courtesy Michael Werner GalleryThere promises to be little, if any, furor over Polke’s windows in Zurich, where feelings about the official religion are tepid—in a canton of 1.25 million people, the Grossmünster, its liberal-minded senior minister, Kathi La Roche, told me, has only about eleven hundred congregants. And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade. A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament. The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦By the lights of many in the international art world, Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke are the leading painters of our day, though it’s hard to find anyone who will declare them equally great. (I’m an exception.) Their careers are intertwined by biography and circumstance. Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

Both are from the former East Germany: Polke, who is sixty-seven, left with his family when he was twelve; Richter, seventy-six, fled, after fitful success in state-run art programs, in 1961, just before the Wall went up. They met at the seminal Düsseldorf Art Academy and, in 1963, collaborated in a brief, trenchant movement that responded to American Pop art with painted imagery drawn from magazine and newspaper ads and photographs, family snapshots, cheap fabric designs, and other desultory sources, which Richter adapted with deadpan gravity and Polke with sardonic élan. A jokey photographic print by Richter, from 1967, shows them sharing a bed in Antwerp. (Their host for a show there had provided scanty accommodations.) They ascended to prominence in the early nineteen-eighties—stunning American art circles, which had been largely oblivious of creative doings in Germany—as twin masters who dramatically expanded the resources and resonances of painting, an art dismissed as moribund by most of that time’s avant-garde. Each has made visually glorious, conceptually seismic pictures. Both live and work in Cologne. But their differences are profound. Richter, reflective and deliberate, is a family man of temperate tastes and orderly habits. His studio is one of two elegant rectilinear buildings—the other is his house—in a large, walled, lushly gardened compound. Polke, restless and impulsive, is an unreconstructed bohemian, inhabiting cluttered expanses in a shabby industrial building. The question “Richter or Polke?” is a common icebreaker, and a self-revealing test, among art students far beyond Germany. To embrace both is to incur a mental civil war, to be of two jealous minds, between incommensurable sensibilities. Temperamentally estranged—Richter’s decorum nettles Polke, whose effrontery exasperates Richter—the men have long been barely on speaking terms.Their career trajectories have lately crossed again, at a peculiarly lofty nexus of art and society: commissions for stained-glass windows in prestigious churches. A vast window by Richter was installed last year in the south transept of the Cologne Cathedral, a Gothic bastion of Roman Catholicism in northern Europe, which was begun in 1248 and finally completed in 1880 (when it became, for four years, the world’s tallest building). It is the Germans’ favorite tourist attraction, according to a recent poll. In Switzerland, twelve windows by Polke—five big ones in glass and the rest, mostly small, in sliced translucent stone—will soon line the thousand-year-old Romanesque Grossmünster (large cathedral), the seat of Zurich’s cantonal state religion—the Evangelical-Reformed Church—and historically a cradle of the Protestant Reformation.Neither artist is a believer. A German critic, Hubertus Butin, has termed Richter “a professed atheist with a strong leaning toward Catholicism”—a characterization that the artist condoned with a sly smile, when I saw him in Cologne. His three children with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, also a painter, were baptized in the cathedral, and two of them sing in the choir. The baptismal ceremonies “made me cry,” he told me. The erudite Polke is deeply versed in religious traditions. He said, “It’s not necessary to believe. Christianity for two thousand years has influenced the arts, architecture, philosophy, society.” Something of a serial monomaniac, Polke evangelizes for whatever interests him. An alchemical romance of elements enters into his choices of materials and pigments for his Zurich windows. My notes from our conversations bristle with mentions of cinnabar, alabaster, malachite, cobalt, lapis lazuli, and other precious stuffs, which he regards as poetic intensifications of the “mothering” substance—the materia—of the universe. His own spiritual bias is pantheistic. “I can accept the power of nature as religious,” he said. He conceives his stone windows as symbols of the creation, conjoining base matter and celestial light.The Grossmünster was built as a Catholic church on the site of a fancy miracle: in the year 286, St. Felix, St. Regula, and St. Exuperantius, decapitated for clinging to their faith, picked up their heads and climbed to the top of a hill, where they dug graves and buried themselves. Charlemagne is supposed to have selected the spot for the church when his horse bowed down there. The Grossmünster was stripped of its altar and nearly all its decorations, under the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, in the sixteenth century. (Zwingli’s radicalism antagonized Martin Luther, and split the Reformation movement. Zwingli was killed in a war between Protestant and Catholic cantons, in 1531.) Disconcertingly, for such a fanatically denuded Protestant sanctuary, Polke’s glass designs—as previewed in computerized sketches, which, he cautioned me, may be subject to substantial changes—are brazenly pictorial, sporting garish images drawn from arcane historical sources. He showed me his inspirations in books from his huge studio library. The images loosely follow a thematic scheme of a type popular during the Middle Ages, which alludes to Old Testament anticipations of Jesus Christ.One sketch, of a window in several panels, presents a wheeling purple shape, on a lavender ground, of eight identical cartoonish swordsmen (referring to the variously blade-wielding Abraham, Charlemagne, and Zwingli); a ram (with reference to sacrifice and the Scapegoat) formed of what looks like spilled blood; and the severed heads of St. Felix and St. Regula being pulled from the earth by purple-sleeved hands. Another displays discontinuous bits of contour and fabric, in grays against a chartreuse ground, that add up to an apparitional figure of a harp-strumming King David. In a third, evoking Elijah’s dream of Heaven, a pattern of multi-colored flagstonelike shapes surrounds what may be an angel who holds a large disk that seems to be embossed, in grays and pinks, with a semi-abstracted fiery chariot—the vehicle of the Greek god Helios, Polke explained. (This got him onto the subject of rounded forms in nature. He said, “God made the earth in small circles.”) The incongruity of an iconophilic style in an iconoclastic church neatly balances the scheme that Richter introduced in Cologne: one of severe geometric abstraction in a color-chart-like grid, amid medieval illustrative glazing.Richter’s window, left (detail), in the Cologne Cathedral, and a Polke stone window for the Grossmünster, in Zurich.

And modern stained glass is amply precedented in the area: there are rather archly showy examples by Augusto Giacometti, a nephew of Alberto, in the Grossmünster, and by Marc Chagall, in the Fraumünster, a nearby church. But controversy lingers in Cologne, where, despite the public’s acceptance, cynics have derided Richter’s work as “pixels” and “confetti.” More seriously, the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, complained to a local newspaper that it “belongs equally in a mosque or another house of prayer,” adding, “If we are going to have a new window, then it should be one that reflects our faith, not just any faith.” He would seem to have a point, his doubtful reference to Islam aside. (Cologne has been roiled by plans to build a mosque for the city’s hundred and twenty thousand Muslim residents, with minarets that would share the skyline with the cathedral’s towers.) The window does feel ecumenical. Meisner, who was not consulted about the commission, found that he had an engagement in Poland on the day of the window’s dedication. The literally paradoxical, if not quite heretical, results of these two projects pose a question of whether, in Christian Europe today, art on celebrated artists’ terms has risen to equality with religion or if religion has sunk to the level of mere art.When directly sunlit, Richter’s south-facing window admits a wash of aureate illumination into the cathedral’s gloomy immensity; at other times, it glows or shimmers. It is beautiful, grand, and entrancing, with the exfoliating specificities of a Bach fugue. Sixty-five feet tall, it consists of eleven thousand five hundred panes of “antique” handblown glass, made by forming a bubble into a cylinder, which, when cooled, is divided along its length. The glass is then reheated and flattened, giving it an uneven texture, with light-refracting ripples. Each more than a foot square, the panes of Richter’s window are imperceptibly joined with silicon glue in six vertical panels and within multitudinous shapes of the crowning Gothic stone tracery. The work replaces an unsatisfactory modern piece, which had, in turn, replaced a nineteenth-century window shattered by Allied bombing during the Second World War. (The cathedral abuts Cologne’s main railroad station, in an area that was blasted all but flat, and its substantial survival is a lasting wonder.) Richter had been asked for thematic imagery, perhaps memorializing one or both of two twentieth-century saints, Father Maximilian Kolbe and Sister Edith Stein, who died at the hands of the Nazis. He tried working from photographs of Nazi executions—shootings, hangings—but decided that the idea was grotesque. Certainly, it’s not easy to conceive of the theme being expressed in fields of luminous color.Richter says that he was about to abandon the project when he happened to lay a template of the window’s frame on a reproduction of one of his many paintings of color grids. “I said, ‘My God! Fantastic!’ ” he told a reporter. “I thought, This is the only thing.” (Polke, in his studio, demonstrated the potency of medieval design for me by plopping a template of his Zurich windows—rounded, in the Romanesque manner, rather than peaked, in the Gothic—onto miscellaneous surfaces, including fabrics and floorboards. All became instantaneously holy.) Richter’s chief model was his own huge painting “4096 Colors” (1974), in which each of a thousand and twenty-four sprayed-enamel colors, in a graduated spectrum of hues and tones, appears four times. It was composed by chance. (Chance is “more clever than I,” he has said.) Richter likewise randomized the window’s squares within sections that mirror one another at intervals, like the rhymes in a verse form. The result employs seventy-two colors that he deemed consistent with those of the cathedral’s forty-three windows dating from 1260 to 1562 (which survived the war in storage), and close enough in tone to avoid spots of disrupting opacity and glare.There promises to be little, if any, furor over Polke’s windows in Zurich, where feelings about the official religion are tepid—in a canton of 1.25 million people, the Grossmünster, its liberal-minded senior minister, Kathi La Roche, told me, has only about eleven hundred congregants.

A shrieking minute later, the piece had an irregular scallop shape. On another floor of the plant, it was fit into an abstract mosaic of colored stones—some untrimmed and quite large, with cores of glittering crystallization and artificially enhanced reds, blues, and violets—which was laid out on a table, awaiting completion with strips of alloyed lead and tin, called cames, in the ancient way of stained glass. “This is Swiss precision!” Polke, looking on, announced with jocular satisfaction. Rickenbach exuded pride. He has limited opportunities to apply his skills to ecclesiastical glazing. The firm that he works for, founded in 1887 to produce and restore stained glass, now does most of its business in custom mirrors, tilework, and shower stalls. He showed me his well-worn hand tools, far older than he is, and small machines for cutting glass and extruding and soldering metal, and he demonstrated techniques of painting on glass. There will be a good deal of painted glass in the Grossmünster windows, on expanses where there are few dividing cames.Laying a clear pane on a Polke drawing of teeming cherubs, Rickenbach swiftly traced the lines with a brush dipped in a solution of iron oxide. Mineral pigments melt into and fuse with the surface when baked at temperatures above eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For the Zurich windows, an abundance of techniques will be employed, including the oldest: the mixing of metallic oxides—such as copper for ruby red, manganese for rose pink, and cobalt for blue—with molten glass. (That was the predominant practice until about 1300, when it was discovered that silver-nitrate solution brushed onto glass stained it yellow, giving the medium its name.) Others will be flashed-glass abrasion (clear panes fused with colored ones which are scraped away to various results), glass fusing (combining layers of different-colored glass), sandblasting, and a traditional procedure called Schwarzlot, the manipulation of black enamel with hand tools that yield delectable names in translation: expellers, draggers, pestles, quills. Polke, whose first job as a teen-ager in West Germany was in stained-glass restoration, enjoys making demands on Rickenbach, who relishes the challenge. Having performed his painting demonstration, Rickenbach picked up a cloth and wiped the glass clean.“It is loud, wet, and cold, but there is no other possibility for this.” So saying, in a dusty factory in Zurich, the young, intense glass master Urs Rickenbach—one of about forty in Switzerland who hold the title—nudged a tiny slice of caramel-colored agate into a water-cooled, diamond-edged circular saw, his fingers nearly touching the blade.

The older it is, the better it is, for the most part. Literary and archeological evidence dates the use of colored glass in churches to the early centuries of the Christian era. The first surviving whole examples are from the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, in Germany and France. The innovation of buttressed architecture enabled large windows by freeing walls from having to hold up their buildings’ weight. The major theorist and first great patron of the develoment, Abbot Suger of St. Denis (1081-1151), promulgated a Neoplatonic doctrine: lux continua—the unbroken light. He distinguished among lux (daylight, which falls alike “on the evil and the good,” according to Matthew), lumen (the consecrated light that has entered sanctuaries), and illumination (of the soul, realizing a condition described in Ephesians: “Now you are light in the Lord, walk as children of light”). “Onward from the material to the immaterial,” Suger wrote. He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.That classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained glass is a confusing art form—if it is an art form, given that its effects blend, or vanish, into architectural functions of decoration and ornament.

He justified the medium’s sensuous allure as a foretaste of the New Jerusalem, which will be bejewelled, as he foresaw it, citing Revelation, with “jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysophase, jacinth, amethyst.” The fragility of windows—subject to mishaps of war, neglect, accident, and foolish renovation, in addition to the long, catastrophic rampages of Protestant malice—insures that we know only a fraction of what was achieved during the era of the late Romanesque and the Gothic.lux continualuxlumenThat classical period ended in the Renaissance, when the word “Gothic” was coined as a retrospective slur, connoting barbarism. The loss of Suger’s theological passion trivialized stained glass: the flat and lapidary mosaic forms, with painted inflections, of medieval windows gave way to artisanal imitations of perspectival and realistic painting, becoming an essentially reproductive craft. (A similar reduction befell the formerly semi-independent art of tapestry, betraying its formal propriety with tricked-out illusions of deep space.) The unitary power of Gothic stained glass, in which figures and their surroundings share the picture plane, equalizing the impacts of side-by-side colors, has haunted glassmakers, and eluded emulation, ever since. Periodic revivals—notably in England in the nineteenth century, promoted by A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelites—have been longer on nostalgia than on persuasion, unless anti-modern reaction is a persuasive cause. Serene intensities of faith don’t yield themselves to stylistic pastiche.Despite certain tours de force by modern artists—the most graceful and gracious being Matisse’s Vence Chapel, with its succinct linear motifs—stained glass now serves mainly as a practical and pretty expedient for places where daylight is wanted, but not a view, or where prettiness is an end in itself. There’s no disgrace in that. Art Nouveau and Jugendstil designers concentrated on the visual pleasures of the medium using novel means, including Louis Comfort Tiffany’s innovations in opalescent glass. (Those movements shared a Zeitgeist with Impressionism, which might be termed, at a stretch, stained glass on canvas: merging imagery with chromatic light.) In architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, among many others, stained glass contributes a ceremonial dignity—an anodyne tincture of churchiness—to secular environments. I’ve seen designs for a promising new project, by the American minimalist painter Robert Mangold, to be installed in the complex of a new federal courthouse in Buffalo: augustly soaring windows, in arrays as high as forty feet, in subtly denatured colors, engraved with laconic linear arabesques. The color will be applied as a baked-in layer of ground glass and pigment on one side of clear panes, executed by a prominent firm in Munich. (German expertise is the field’s gold standard, by general consent. Polke acknowledged that his choice of a Swiss company for a Swiss commission was politic, adding that the ardent Rickenbach has given him no cause for regret.)Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate. It is hard even to see. Our eyesight is wired to make sense of light falling on objects, not shining through them. When presented with variably bright sources, we automatically select the brightest, consigning the rest to shadow. Effects of sun-ignited color swamp those of mosaic composition and depicted image. What do we actually absorb amid the singing marvels of Chartres Cathedral, to cite perhaps the finest of the Gothic survivors (a hundred and fifty-two wholly or partly twelfth-and thirteenth-century windows), or in the swimmy glory of the most extravagant, the thirteenth-century Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris? (“But that’s kitschy!” Polke scoffed, when I mentioned Sainte-Chapelle.) My own keenest pleasure in stained glass occurs at first glance—a “Wow!” moment, like the here-and-gone dazzle of fireworks. To be sustained, the experience calls for an organizing idea, a ruling fiction, making disorientation meaningful.Richter and Polke have addressed that need, in ways both hypermodern and attuned to Gothic wisdom. Richter’s Cologne window delivers an incessant first impression. You are always just beginning to behold it, in a mental state that is at once unfocussed and undistracted. Persisting, you may sense slight changes in the day’s light—tiny, barely registered visual thunderclaps. The experience interpenetrates with that of the cathedral’s droning cavernousness (the air has a sound) to induce a mood that, if it isn’t spiritual, has no name. The mind of a devout Catholic, thus voided of mundane reference, might well fill with Catholic sentiments. Of course, nothing prevents the respective blossoming of other dispositions—those of trespassers, in Cardinal Meisner’s stoutly parochial view. But if Richter doesn’t provide a hard answer to the mystery of religious longings, he certainly pries open the question.As for Polke, count on him to pepper the conundrum with miscellaneous meanings. He has long been perhaps history’s only mystically inclined Pop artist. (A 1969 painting bears the German words for “Higher powers command: Paint the upper right corner black”; the upper right corner is painted black.) His researches have included use of hallucinogenic drugs—“to be rational,” he said—which coincided with a reduction in his output in the early seventies. (He recalled a spell of communal living in Zurich around that time.) “I am a popular artist for the daily life,” Polke remarked, leaving me to envision a notion of daily life that is a good deal more intricate than the bare phrase suggests. His gaudy designs for Zurich may be a kind of travesty, but their impertinence stirs dormant roots of belief to aggravated consciousness. Richter always determinedly trips up the expectations of our settled tastes in art; Polke continuously embarrasses them. In either case, we are brought to a verge of things that we know we don’t know—palpably actual and ineluctably veiled in the streaming light of day. ♦Stained-glass art, including that of Gothic masterworks, is hard to contemplate.

        "text": "Toys, aircraft-window panels, and her own medical X-rays are just some of the materials that have tantalized the German artist Isa Genz­ken, whose inventive, mercurial output over the past 40 years continues to thwart attempts at categorization. Painting, assemblages, and skyscraper-like constructions have all found a place in her work. Born in 1948, Genzken came of age with a postwar generation of German artists, many of whom quickly became much better known than her — among them, Sigmar Polke and Genzken’s ex-husband, Gerhard Richter. Genz­ken, who has grappled with bipolar disorder for much of her adult life, eventually became an art star in Europe, and rose to prominence in the United States in 2013, following her critically acclaimed retrospective at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. For that traveling exhibition, Genzken created the first of her \"Schauspieler (Actors)\" sculptures, presented as an installation of 13 mannequins, many wearing her own clothing, combined with props and accessories that held meaning for her. Positioned in various arrangements, they suggested self-portraiture and reflected on consumer culture.The sculptor has since produced ­\"Schau­spieler\" for other shows, working, as she has for more than 20 years, in a vast loft inside a former industrial building in Berlin. In 2016, the mannequins were featured in a survey exhibition at Berlin’s Martin-Gropius-Bau, organized by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and additional iterations are currently on view in Genzken’s first large-scale solo exhibition in California, at Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, a show of new work by the artist, featuring primarily collages, opens at Galerie Buchholz, in New York, on November 2, the same day that Genzken will be the honoree at the SculptureCenter’s annual benefit gala.Genzken, who is tall and striking, favors men’s clothing, and has her leather pants and jackets custom-made at Rob Berlin, a gay fetish retailer. The artist has typically outfitted her mannequins in clothes from her own wardrobe, but for this W commission, Genzken reworked runway pieces that were sent to her, reconstructing and deconstructing them as she saw fit, on mannequins she selected and adding props that she found herself. Assembling them in a line in front of a work in progress, she envisioned a silent catwalk populated by these uncanny products of her teeming mind.XClothes Encounters: See Artist Isa Genzken's Spectacular W CommissionWatch W's most popular videos here:Toys, aircraft-window panels, and her own medical X-rays are just some of the materials that have tantalized the German artist Isa Genz­ken, whose inventive, mercurial output over the past 40 years continues to thwart attempts at categorization.
