        "text": "“I actually hate the idea of selfies,” says Cindy Sherman while discussing recent images she has been making with her iPhone. “People say”—she adopts a naive tone—“ ‘Oh, but you’re, like, the queen of selfies,’ ” and then her voice goes flat. “I really kind of cringe at that thought.”Sherman, who turns 64 in January, has, of course, earned her place as one of today’s great artists by taking photographs in which she almost always appears as the only subject—affecting clowns in elaborate get-ups, self-serious socialites with impressive wardrobes and withering stares, early Hollywood screen stars late in their careers, and plenty of other characters who defy any succinct description.But the images, she has always maintained, do not depict Sherman herself. “I don’t see it that way, no,” she says. Rather, Sherman exposes how culture shapes appearances, imploding such enforced conformity from within. Since she has long resisted autobiographical readings of her work, it has been intriguing lately to see her take to, and toy with, Instagram, a platform that thrives on interplay of the personal and the artificial, especially when it comes to self-portraiture.Cindy Sherman Cindy ShermanThis past summer, Sherman took her private account public, and she has quickly amassed tens of thousands of followers who can now view dramatic sunsets and landscapes, lusciously colored vegetables, and portraits in which she stars that are, by turns, unhinged and uproarious. She began creating these images earlier this year, after a makeup artist who had done her face took a photo with her. “I was so impressed with how he made me look,” she recalls. A week later, though, a friend showed her an app called Facetune, and “I realized that he had actually used this app to just make all of my wrinkles and lines go away,” she says. Sherman now uses Facetune for her own Instagram portraits, as well as two more apps, Perfect365 and YouCam Makeup, to tweak facial features, apply makeup, and toss on accessories.In Photoshop, which she uses in her artwork, she is able to alter every little detail, but these apps were designed to meet specific needs. “It’s really only about making things prettier,” she says. And yet, Sherman has managed to tease highly unorthodox results—and, often, grotesqueries—from these tools. The women she has created have inflamed skin, warped noses, piercing eyes. Occasionally, identical ghosts burst from their heads or pattern their bodies. Nevertheless, they seem knowable, and lovable, perhaps because of the intimate nature of Instagram or because they have been built with tools that aim to serve desires we can identify. They embody understandable intentions that have gone awry.The portraits are not without pathos, in other words, and it seems relevant that Sherman made many of them while convalescing after an injury. “I was kind of just lying around with nothing to do and playing with my phone,” she says, adding that since her recovery, she has had less time to devote to the pursuit, and is beginning to find the experience repetitive. “I feel like I’m looking for something else—another place to take it to.”Cindy Sherman Cindy ShermanSherman’s project for W apes the social media phenomenon known as the plandid—the planned candid photograph, which is “like a newer, hotter version of the selfie on Instagram,” as one social media expert recently put it. They are carefully composed images of studious nonchalance; they capture subjects who are determinedly carefree. Presented here is a mise en abyme of looking: a woman—or should I say women?—posing for herself on her phone as she poses for another photo that she is pretending not to pose for. Perhaps we are seeing the same images that she is viewing on her screen as she tries out different visages on the fly, shuttling through an uncountable number of aesthetic options with taps and glides of her finger. These works have a particular charge at a time when we snap ourselves with the understanding that our image will ricochet onto any number of screens, devices, and platforms. We are all striving to get it right.Sherman is characteristically humble, almost flip, about her new digital concretions. “All these Instagram images are, for me, just playing around,” she says. “I don’t think it at all competes with my serious work. They’re just fun, like a little distraction.” But while she says that these “silly sketches” have not yet influenced her art directly, she does seem to be enjoying the ease with which these programs function. “I’m not such a perfectionist with using the apps. If you can erase the background and add another background, I don’t really care if the edges are all clean, and if it looks kind of funky, or if things overlap in a not-so-perfect way. It’s kind of freeing me up a little bit and maybe making me more open to experimentation.”Originally, Sherman planned to work from different photographs for this piece, but after completing the first, she said to herself, “You know, let’s see if I can make the same image completely different, because it’s so easy to do with the app.” By taking a single photo and running it through a series of algorithms, conjuring an array of images from one source, she is indulging a process that is central to an era when surface-level identity and truth can seem variegated and unmoored—a reality at once disorienting, disturbing, and, in the right hands, deeply thrilling.How to take a selfie like a supermodel:“I actually hate the idea of selfies,” says Cindy Sherman while discussing recent images she has been making with her iPhone. “People say”—she adopts a naive tone—“ ‘Oh, but you’re, like, the queen of selfies,’ ” and then her voice goes flat. “I really kind of cringe at that thought.”Sherman, who turns 64 in January, has, of course, earned her place as one of today’s great artists by taking photographs in which she almost always appears as the only subject—affecting clowns in elaborate get-ups, self-serious socialites with impressive wardrobes and withering stares, early Hollywood screen stars late in their careers, and plenty of other characters who defy any succinct description.But the images, she has always maintained, do not depict Sherman herself. “I don’t see it that way, no,” she says.

        "text": "‘When I began, in the mid-1970s, I was just fooling around,” remembers Cindy Sherman. “I had no idea I would really become an artist. I never would have thought I’d be doing this for 35 years. It happened organically—one series turned into another.”And here we are. With her never-ending parade of performance photos—in which Sherman has been a one-woman band, almost always using herself as the guinea pig, doing her own hair, makeup, styling, directing, posing, and prop-hunting—she has arguably become the most popular woman artist of all time (beating out Georgia O’Keeffe!). And the most successful: an image from her 1981 “Centerfold” series sold at auction last May for nearly $3.9 million, at the time the most ever paid for a single photograph from the lens of either gender. Sherman is also roundly respected by critics and curators and is about to have a major retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York (February 26 through June 11, 2012), which will then travel the country through the middle of 2013.Sherman, who has probably put on more wigs, noses, lips, eyebrows, and hats—but never airs—than anyone alive, says, “I totally lucked out.” So did we, her audience. Because all along she has kept herself, and us, entertained. Often spellbound. Sometimes horrified, even squeamish. But never bored.Sherman seems amused that when people meet her—the real Cindy Sherman—they’re surprised. “They have a quizzical look on their faces, as if I’ve let them down,” she says, laughing kind of. “I’m supposed to be weirder. I’m sort of mild-mannered, and they can’t believe I’m the same person who creates these crazy characters.” Actually, though, Sherman has always been a character herself. We cut our teeth together in the New York contemporary-art world of the late 1970s, which was the opposite of today’s art world. Money and power were not the aphrodisiacs they seem to be now; they were suspect. So were institutions and commercial galleries. Business was paltry; ideas were plentiful. It was the perfect petri dish for Sherman, who made ends meet by working at the front desk at Artists Space, a classic “alternative” exhibition venue of the time. The fact that she would sometimes show up for work dressed as, say, a nurse, or in a pinkish suit à la Jackie Kennedy, but frumpier, with cat-eye glasses on, is now part of art-world lore.The backstory is pure Sherman. “I’d be home, fooling around with makeup and a costume, maybe picked up at a thrift store, and suddenly I’d look at my watch and go: Oh, wow, I have to get to work. Well, O.K., I’ll just go like this.” Not only did the bosses not mind; one of them became a founder of her first gallery, Metro Pictures, where she shows to this day. Such mutual loyalty is rare these days, to say the least. Also unusual is the breathtaking range that Sherman has managed to bring to her work over the decades—from the “film stills” of the late 1970s to the “centerfolds” of the early 1980s, to the historical appropriations of the late 1980s, and on to “Hollywood Hamptons,” the “clowns,” and the “society portraits” of this century. (Her photos and shows are all untitled but have developed informal names.) Along the way, she has created a body of work that also serves as a meditation on aging, and on the ages—all of it maintaining her particular vision, her acute powers of observation, no matter the variety of images or the technology she uses. As a person, Sherman can seem casual—but never her pictures. Her art is in the details, and often in the humor too. When she first began exhibiting her photographs, critics correctly contextualized the work as belonging to the feminist discourse of the time, but the pleasure and more personal emotions she got from playing with her characters were always important to Sherman, too.Eva Respini, the associate curator at MoMA who has organized the Sherman show, says, “Every brush of makeup, every earring, every hair tells us something about the persona and character she has drawn. Sherman at her very best always has her finger on the pulse. She was contemporary in the 80s; she was contemporary in the 90s; and, boy, in the 2000s is she on point again. Her 2008 ‘society portraits’ were disparaging, tragic, vulgar, and quite empathic. These were women of a certain age, from the top echelons of polite society—they could be politicians’ wives, art patrons, reality-show housewives. The works are monumental portraits of women who are struggling with a culture that has these ridiculous standards for youth, for beauty, and for wealth and status.”Another shocker: unlike so many of her fellow superstar artists, Sherman works alone, often in her understated studio—where years of props and costumes are neatly organized—usually with a mirror next to the camera so she can see how the shoot is going. She explains the process: “Suddenly the reflection I’m looking at is not at all me. Suddenly it’s like a phantom that’s just popped out of the mirror, and that’s when I know the character is right on. There have been moments where I remember this thing suddenly appearing and I can’t believe that’s me!”Sherman is also disbelieving that she is having an exhibition at MoMA organized under the auspices of the Department of Photography. “When I was starting my stuff, I felt completely isolated from traditional photography,” she confesses. “I felt like an outcast, not just from the photography world but even from the art world, which was all about painting and sculpture back then—mostly male painting and sculpture. That’s why a lot of women from my generation tried to find new directions to go in.” Just goes to show what a misfit can do.‘When I began, in the mid-1970s, I was just fooling around,” remembers Cindy Sherman. “I had no idea I would really become an artist.

Also unusual is the breathtaking range that Sherman has managed to bring to her work over the decades—from the “film stills” of the late 1970s to the “centerfolds” of the early 1980s, to the historical appropriations of the late 1980s, and on to “Hollywood Hamptons,” the “clowns,” and the “society portraits” of this century. (Her photos and shows are all untitled but have developed informal names.) Along the way, she has created a body of work that also serves as a meditation on aging, and on the ages—all of it maintaining her particular vision, her acute powers of observation, no matter the variety of images or the technology she uses. As a person, Sherman can seem casual—but never her pictures. Her art is in the details, and often in the humor too. When she first began exhibiting her photographs, critics correctly contextualized the work as belonging to the feminist discourse of the time, but the pleasure and more personal emotions she got from playing with her characters were always important to Sherman, too.Eva Respini, the associate curator at MoMA who has organized the Sherman show, says, “Every brush of makeup, every earring, every hair tells us something about the persona and character she has drawn. Sherman at her very best always has her finger on the pulse. She was contemporary in the 80s; she was contemporary in the 90s; and, boy, in the 2000s is she on point again. Her 2008 ‘society portraits’ were disparaging, tragic, vulgar, and quite empathic. These were women of a certain age, from the top echelons of polite society—they could be politicians’ wives, art patrons, reality-show housewives. The works are monumental portraits of women who are struggling with a culture that has these ridiculous standards for youth, for beauty, and for wealth and status.”Another shocker: unlike so many of her fellow superstar artists, Sherman works alone, often in her understated studio—where years of props and costumes are neatly organized—usually with a mirror next to the camera so she can see how the shoot is going. She explains the process: “Suddenly the reflection I’m looking at is not at all me. Suddenly it’s like a phantom that’s just popped out of the mirror, and that’s when I know the character is right on. There have been moments where I remember this thing suddenly appearing and I can’t believe that’s me!”Sherman is also disbelieving that she is having an exhibition at MoMA organized under the auspices of the Department of Photography. “When I was starting my stuff, I felt completely isolated from traditional photography,” she confesses. “I felt like an outcast, not just from the photography world but even from the art world, which was all about painting and sculpture back then—mostly male painting and sculpture. That’s why a lot of women from my generation tried to find new directions to go in.” Just goes to show what a misfit can do.Eva Respini, the associate curator at MoMA who has organized the Sherman show, says, “Every brush of makeup, every earring, every hair tells us something about the persona and character she has drawn.

        "text": "Cindy Sherman the ultimate shape-shifter poses for us on the eve of exhibiting a new set of character portraits at New York’s Metro Pictures Gallery. For “20 questions,” friends and colleagues of the artist were invited to pose a question. What follows are Sherman’s responses.Barbara Kruger: When you were young, did your hopes for how your life might unfold look anything like how it has actually come to be?Cindy Sherman: No. The closest I came was thinking that I’d be a street artist or a court illustrator.Robert Longo: People know you as an extremely accessible, kind, and graceful artist. But what or who really gets you angry, and does any of it play itself out in your artwork?CS: Inconsiderate, rude behavior drives me nuts. And I guess the inconsiderate rudeness of social ineptitude definitely fuels my work.Johanna Burton: What keeps you going?CS: I try to change what I do—if only incrementally—to make me feel like I’m not stagnating.JB: And what keeps you up at night? CS: I’m an occasional insomniac, so anything keeps me up.Peter Schjeldahl: When were you most stuck about what to do next, and what did you do next?CS: Right after 9/11 I couldn’t see the point in making art. My first attempts were too sad and lifeless. Then I made a couple of Rosie the Riveter-type of portraits: heroic ordinary women, full of optimism.Isabelle Graw: If we assume that artworks, when circulating on the market, are seen both for their symbolic and their market value, and if we furthermore assume that the price of an artwork is arbitrary and differs from its symbolic importance, how would you describe the intellectual surplus value that your work generates and provides?CS: I don’t think I can explain it, and I can only take your word that it’s true. I don’t analyze what I’m doing. I’ve read convincing interpretations of my work, and sometimes I’ve noticed something that I wasn’t aware of, but I think, at this point, people read into my work out of habit. Or I’m just very, very smart.Calvin Tomkins: Which one of the “Untitled Film Stills” comes closest to the real Cindy Sherman?CS: The “crying” one—Untitled Film Still #27, 1979. Not because I’m a sad person—I’m not—but because in all of the others I’m posed in a self-conscious (though sometimes reflexive) way, and the crying girl has that layer peeled away, showing a vulnerability that I do relate to.Linda Yablonsky: What word or phrase would you like to see as your epitaph?CS: “She finally found the perfect outfit.”Isabelle Huppert: Do you feel strong or weak? CS: I can be fearlessly strong at times to protect an inner frailty.Peter Galassi: Has a critic or a curator ever asked you a question that led you to consider your work in a way you hadn’t expected?CS: Early in my career, a critic said that I needed to “explain” the irony in my work, suggesting that I needed to add text next to the images to help people understand what I was trying to say. At first I was dismayed that I wasn’t making work with a clear enough message. That’s when I realized that that was the exact opposite of what I wanted to do—that I wasn’t responsible for a misinterpretation of my work, that there should be some ambiguity to it. They either got it, or they didn’t.Margaret Lee: Have you ever taken personal style cues from any of your characters?CS: When I was shooting the film stills, the clothes I used were my clothes.Betsy Berne: How would you define success?CS: Being able to make a living doing something one truly loves to do.Marvin Heiferman: If for the next year, the only thing you could put up on your wall to look at was a single photographic portrait—of anyone, by anyone—what would you pick and why?CS: Man Ray’s portrait of Marcel Duchamp as Rrose Sélavy because almost anything by Man Ray would do, but Duchamp is one of my all-time heroes.Vera Dika: If you could animate one of your photographs and turn it into a movie, which one would you choose, and why?CS: A new piece I’ve just done. I refer to her as Jersey Girl. She’s an older woman—although probably my age!—and it looks like she’s shimmying up towards an admirer in a trashy disco. That’s as far as I can see of the movie for now. I think she’s one of the most real characters I’ve ever done. I just see her coming to life.Klaus Kertess: How do you choose thepersonas you take on in your photographs?CS: Sometimes just a wig, an item of clothing, or a prop can trigger the character. I also save images of interesting faces from magazines and newspapers and make myself up to look like them-but they usually turn out nothing like the original.Laurence Kardish: How do you relate the process of your photographic work to the making of your 1997 film Office Killer?CS: It’s almost impossible to compare, or perhaps I should say, they’re polar opposites. Before I made Office Killer, I’d never worked with a crew before, nor had I worked with a literal narrative or actors or on such a tight schedule. I’d never even thought about compromise when I worked in my studio. The main similarity is in the visual concept and the result. The major distinction is in the priority of who I ultimately wanted to please: myself or the audience. I wouldn’t want to make another film if I didn’t know exactly what I wanted it to be, and couldn’t be faithful to that vision.Matthew Higgs: What question would you like to ask yourself?CS: Why all the shoes?Arthur C. Danto: Is there some kind of message you hope will come through your work? CS: For people to not take anything for granted, to respect what they might not understand.Miranda July: What did you do today?CS: I ate breakfast, read the paper, answered e-mails, went to the gym, talked to my assistant, ate lunch, made phone calls, met with the electrician, looked at slides, worked on the computer, got ready to go out, saw a performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and went to a party afterward.Kent Jones: To what extent do you think you are able to see the world through the eyes of others—loved ones and strangers, the well-known and the anonymous, the living and the dead—and with what level of success?CS: I don’t think I can see the world through other people’s eyes, but I can capture an attitude or a look that makes others think I can. I have an appreciation for why people choose to look the way they do. But I can’t know what they experience.Cindy Sherman the ultimate shape-shifter poses for us on the eve of exhibiting a new set of character portraits at New York’s Metro Pictures Gallery.

Not because I’m a sad person—I’m not—but because in all of the others I’m posed in a self-conscious (though sometimes reflexive) way, and the crying girl has that layer peeled away, showing a vulnerability that I do relate to.Linda Yablonsky: What word or phrase would you like to see as your epitaph?CS: “She finally found the perfect outfit.”Isabelle Huppert: Do you feel strong or weak? CS: I can be fearlessly strong at times to protect an inner frailty.Peter Galassi: Has a critic or a curator ever asked you a question that led you to consider your work in a way you hadn’t expected?CS: Early in my career, a critic said that I needed to “explain” the irony in my work, suggesting that I needed to add text next to the images to help people understand what I was trying to say. At first I was dismayed that I wasn’t making work with a clear enough message. That’s when I realized that that was the exact opposite of what I wanted to do—that I wasn’t responsible for a misinterpretation of my work, that there should be some ambiguity to it. They either got it, or they didn’t.Margaret Lee: Have you ever taken personal style cues from any of your characters?CS: When I was shooting the film stills, the clothes I used were my clothes.Betsy Berne: How would you define success?CS: Being able to make a living doing something one truly loves to do.Marvin Heiferman: If for the next year, the only thing you could put up on your wall to look at was a single photographic portrait—of anyone, by anyone—what would you pick and why?CS: Man Ray’s portrait of Marcel Duchamp as Rrose Sélavy because almost anything by Man Ray would do, but Duchamp is one of my all-time heroes.Vera Dika: If you could animate one of your photographs and turn it into a movie, which one would you choose, and why?CS: A new piece I’ve just done. I refer to her as Jersey Girl. She’s an older woman—although probably my age!—and it looks like she’s shimmying up towards an admirer in a trashy disco. That’s as far as I can see of the movie for now. I think she’s one of the most real characters I’ve ever done. I just see her coming to life.Klaus Kertess: How do you choose thepersonas you take on in your photographs?CS: Sometimes just a wig, an item of clothing, or a prop can trigger the character. I also save images of interesting faces from magazines and newspapers and make myself up to look like them-but they usually turn out nothing like the original.Laurence Kardish: How do you relate the process of your photographic work to the making of your 1997 film Office Killer?CS: It’s almost impossible to compare, or perhaps I should say, they’re polar opposites. Before I made Office Killer, I’d never worked with a crew before, nor had I worked with a literal narrative or actors or on such a tight schedule. I’d never even thought about compromise when I worked in my studio. The main similarity is in the visual concept and the result. The major distinction is in the priority of who I ultimately wanted to please: myself or the audience. I wouldn’t want to make another film if I didn’t know exactly what I wanted it to be, and couldn’t be faithful to that vision.Matthew Higgs: What question would you like to ask yourself?CS: Why all the shoes?Arthur C. Danto: Is there some kind of message you hope will come through your work? CS: For people to not take anything for granted, to respect what they might not understand.Miranda July: What did you do today?CS: I ate breakfast, read the paper, answered e-mails, went to the gym, talked to my assistant, ate lunch, made phone calls, met with the electrician, looked at slides, worked on the computer, got ready to go out, saw a performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and went to a party afterward.Kent Jones: To what extent do you think you are able to see the world through the eyes of others—loved ones and strangers, the well-known and the anonymous, the living and the dead—and with what level of success?CS: I don’t think I can see the world through other people’s eyes, but I can capture an attitude or a look that makes others think I can. I have an appreciation for why people choose to look the way they do. But I can’t know what they experience.Cindy Sherman the ultimate shape-shifter poses for us on the eve of exhibiting a new set of character portraits at New York’s Metro Pictures Gallery. For “20 questions,” friends and colleagues of the artist were invited to pose a question. What follows are Sherman’s responses.Barbara Kruger: When you were young, did your hopes for how your life might unfold look anything like how it has actually come to be?Cindy Sherman: No. The closest I came was thinking that I’d be a street artist or a court illustrator.Robert Longo: People know you as an extremely accessible, kind, and graceful artist. But what or who really gets you angry, and does any of it play itself out in your artwork?CS: Inconsiderate, rude behavior drives me nuts. And I guess the inconsiderate rudeness of social ineptitude definitely fuels my work.Johanna Burton: What keeps you going?CS: I try to change what I do—if only incrementally—to make me feel like I’m not stagnating.JB: And what keeps you up at night? CS: I’m an occasional insomniac, so anything keeps me up.Peter Schjeldahl: When were you most stuck about what to do next, and what did you do next?CS: Right after 9/11 I couldn’t see the point in making art. My first attempts were too sad and lifeless. Then I made a couple of Rosie the Riveter-type of portraits: heroic ordinary women, full of optimism.Isabelle Graw: If we assume that artworks, when circulating on the market, are seen both for their symbolic and their market value, and if we furthermore assume that the price of an artwork is arbitrary and differs from its symbolic importance, how would you describe the intellectual surplus value that your work generates and provides?CS: I don’t think I can explain it, and I can only take your word that it’s true. I don’t analyze what I’m doing. I’ve read convincing interpretations of my work, and sometimes I’ve noticed something that I wasn’t aware of, but I think, at this point, people read into my work out of habit.

        "text": "Given the myriad characters populating artist Cindy Sherman’s universe, you arrive at her studio expecting to discover a teeming stage set. But step inside her duplex penthouse in Manhattan’s TriBeCa and you find Sherman alone in a tidy, hushed oasis. For more than three decades, she has focused on a single model—herself—transforming a shy, private woman into all manner of female archetypes, from radiant Renaissance Madonna and pulpy pinup to sultry screen siren and desperate clown. Here, amid the mannequins, wigs, body parts, and props that fill her photographs—and her closets—Sherman plays director, makeup artist, stylist, costumer, and unassuming star.Sherman wearing Balenciaga in Untitled, 2007/2008.“I can’t focus without order, because once I start working, it’s a total mess in here,” Sherman told me as she gave me a tour. Her studio, a long, windowed room with a fake stone fireplace, connects to her bedroom via a narrow passageway and takes up half the lower level. “I throw costumes and wigs on the floor because I want to see everything. I’ll try things on and go through each box until something clicks.”Sherman pulled out a sliding door, part of the built-in closet, to show me the bins piled on floor-to-ceiling shelves behind it. A feat of organization, everything on view was labeled: reptiles, fingers, facial hair, doll parts. She pointed out a row of vintage heads used in beauty schools and a tiny mannequin intended for practicing CPR on children—discovered, like nearly all of her materials, at “weird yard sales” and in thrift shops and novelty stores. Nearby stood racks of robes she’d brought back from Morocco and “Upper East Side ladies cast-off stuff,” as she called the clothes she used in her 2008 series of portraits of society doyennes.Now the subject of a MoMA retrospective opening February 26, Sherman has amassed so many wigs, she said, that she has had to not only categorize them by color but also “separate them into men’s wigs, clown wigs, and then wigs that have a lot of potential.” She motioned to the windowsill, where three brown wigs (“ordinary hairstyles you’d see on somebody in midtown, maybe a tourist or a secretary”) appeared to be gazing out, waiting to be put to use. “I could throw them in a box,” she acknowledged, “but then they’d get rumpled and lose their shape—and these are ready to go.”Sherman’s own bright blonde hair was damp, and her face was free of makeup. Devoid of strong features, it’s an ideal canvas for her large-scale color portraits, though on that day, one of her blue eyes was stained red, the result of a burst blood vessel, making the other look strikingly blue. Years of practice have made Sherman adept at doing her hair and makeup, and she finds her way into a role only as she transforms herself and puts on the costume, studying each effect in the mirror set up next to her camera. Moving from 35mm film to digital technology has allowed Sherman to see results immediately, without having to break character. “The fact that she’s so self-contained gets to the very heart of her work,” says Eva Respini, the curator of the MoMA show. “Taking on a persona, getting into character, and performing for the camera is a very private act for her. She can only let loose when she’s on her own.”From top: A dress from her costume closet; rows of doll and beauty-shop heads in her closet.Sherman, 58, has been constructing guises for much of her life. Growing up on New York’s Long Island the youngest of five kids, she kept a collection of Troll dolls—dwarflike creatures with neon-colored hair—and created shoebox houses for them. At 12, she walked around her neighborhood dressed as an old woman, wearing her great-grandmother’s dress, stockings, and bloomers, with stuffed socks standing in for sagging breasts. She digs out a framed photograph of her taken at that time, joking that it’s probably the first Cindy Sherman work.Increasingly, she’s channeling more of herself into her projects but insists her photographs are not autobiographical, calling them performances: “You’d never ask an actor if they were playing themselves even if you can recognize them.” And while revealing herself is not her intention, she allows that the newfound vulnerability critics praised in her 2008 portraits of aging affluent women arose from her feeling of kinship with her subjects. “It was scary how easy it was to become these women—those wrinkles in the neck, you know, they weren’t makeup,” she said with a laugh. “My thought about these women was that they were showing off their fantastic lives and wealth and yet couldn’t hide the price they had paid to get there. I could ­identify with being really successful and at the same time feeling like life isn’t always so perfect even when you think you have it all.”For her latest photographs, to be unveiled in April at New York’s Metro Pictures, Sherman had her pick of the Chanel ­archive, selecting the outfits from images sent to her by the famous fashion house. Once she made her choices, “they started sending me big coffinlike trunks stuffed like there was an invisible body inside of them.” It was her first experience wearing couture. “I didn’t want to take the hours it would take to do makeup,” she recalled, “because the clothes were so valuable and also pretty excruciating to wear, mostly because I couldn’t get them on.” Unable to zip up a beaded chiffon gown, she had to hold up the dress with one arm while she shot the picture with the other. “I was just so pissed because every time I’d go to pick up a mirror, the dress would fall off. Beads were falling on the floor, and I’m crunching on them. So it kind of affected the characters.” Ultimately, she shot herself in front of a green screen, then Photoshopped in her face and the “crazy Icelandic landscapes” she’d snapped on a recent trip.An art star since the eighties, Sherman set an auction record for photography last May when her Untitled from 1981 sold for $3.89 million. (It has since been topped.) Those kinds of prices have no doubt helped support her penchant for Prada, Marni, Narciso Rodriguez, and Marc Jacobs­—as a glimpse of the walk-in closet and racks of shoes in her bedroom suite attested. Still, she has sat front row at only a handful of shows, she told me—one of them Balenciaga after she was commissioned to do a series of portraits of Balenciaga-clad fashion characters (the editrix, the party hopper, the critic), which is now part of François Pinault’s permanent collection. Two considerations give her pause: “There’s the clothes to sort out. I have to think about what I’ll wear,” she said. What’s worse, however, is the possibility that she’ll be photographed by somebody else. “And that’s never comfortable,” she admitted. “Those women who are able to suddenly strike a pose? I would love to be able to do that.”Untitled: courtesy of the Artist and Metro PicturesGiven the myriad characters populating artist Cindy Sherman’s universe, you arrive at her studio expecting to discover a teeming stage set.

So it kind of affected the characters.” Ultimately, she shot herself in front of a green screen, then Photoshopped in her face and the “crazy Icelandic landscapes” she’d snapped on a recent trip.An art star since the eighties, Sherman set an auction record for photography last May when her Untitled from 1981 sold for $3.89 million. (It has since been topped.) Those kinds of prices have no doubt helped support her penchant for Prada, Marni, Narciso Rodriguez, and Marc Jacobs­—as a glimpse of the walk-in closet and racks of shoes in her bedroom suite attested. Still, she has sat front row at only a handful of shows, she told me—one of them Balenciaga after she was commissioned to do a series of portraits of Balenciaga-clad fashion characters (the editrix, the party hopper, the critic), which is now part of François Pinault’s permanent collection. Two considerations give her pause: “There’s the clothes to sort out. I have to think about what I’ll wear,” she said. What’s worse, however, is the possibility that she’ll be photographed by somebody else. “And that’s never comfortable,” she admitted. “Those women who are able to suddenly strike a pose? I would love to be able to do that.”Untitled: courtesy of the Artist and Metro PicturesGiven the myriad characters populating artist Cindy Sherman’s universe, you arrive at her studio expecting to discover a teeming stage set. But step inside her duplex penthouse in Manhattan’s TriBeCa and you find Sherman alone in a tidy, hushed oasis. For more than three decades, she has focused on a single model—herself—transforming a shy, private woman into all manner of female archetypes, from radiant Renaissance Madonna and pulpy pinup to sultry screen siren and desperate clown. Here, amid the mannequins, wigs, body parts, and props that fill her photographs—and her closets—Sherman plays director, makeup artist, stylist, costumer, and unassuming star.Sherman wearing Balenciaga in Untitled, 2007/2008.“I can’t focus without order, because once I start working, it’s a total mess in here,” Sherman told me as she gave me a tour. Her studio, a long, windowed room with a fake stone fireplace, connects to her bedroom via a narrow passageway and takes up half the lower level. “I throw costumes and wigs on the floor because I want to see everything. I’ll try things on and go through each box until something clicks.”Sherman pulled out a sliding door, part of the built-in closet, to show me the bins piled on floor-to-ceiling shelves behind it. A feat of organization, everything on view was labeled: reptiles, fingers, facial hair, doll parts. She pointed out a row of vintage heads used in beauty schools and a tiny mannequin intended for practicing CPR on children—discovered, like nearly all of her materials, at “weird yard sales” and in thrift shops and novelty stores. Nearby stood racks of robes she’d brought back from Morocco and “Upper East Side ladies cast-off stuff,” as she called the clothes she used in her 2008 series of portraits of society doyennes.Now the subject of a MoMA retrospective opening February 26, Sherman has amassed so many wigs, she said, that she has had to not only categorize them by color but also “separate them into men’s wigs, clown wigs, and then wigs that have a lot of potential.” She motioned to the windowsill, where three brown wigs (“ordinary hairstyles you’d see on somebody in midtown, maybe a tourist or a secretary”) appeared to be gazing out, waiting to be put to use. “I could throw them in a box,” she acknowledged, “but then they’d get rumpled and lose their shape—and these are ready to go.”Sherman’s own bright blonde hair was damp, and her face was free of makeup. Devoid of strong features, it’s an ideal canvas for her large-scale color portraits, though on that day, one of her blue eyes was stained red, the result of a burst blood vessel, making the other look strikingly blue. Years of practice have made Sherman adept at doing her hair and makeup, and she finds her way into a role only as she transforms herself and puts on the costume, studying each effect in the mirror set up next to her camera. Moving from 35mm film to digital technology has allowed Sherman to see results immediately, without having to break character. “The fact that she’s so self-contained gets to the very heart of her work,” says Eva Respini, the curator of the MoMA show. “Taking on a persona, getting into character, and performing for the camera is a very private act for her. She can only let loose when she’s on her own.”From top: A dress from her costume closet; rows of doll and beauty-shop heads in her closet.Sherman, 58, has been constructing guises for much of her life. Growing up on New York’s Long Island the youngest of five kids, she kept a collection of Troll dolls—dwarflike creatures with neon-colored hair—and created shoebox houses for them. At 12, she walked around her neighborhood dressed as an old woman, wearing her great-grandmother’s dress, stockings, and bloomers, with stuffed socks standing in for sagging breasts. She digs out a framed photograph of her taken at that time, joking that it’s probably the first Cindy Sherman work.Increasingly, she’s channeling more of herself into her projects but insists her photographs are not autobiographical, calling them performances: “You’d never ask an actor if they were playing themselves even if you can recognize them.” And while revealing herself is not her intention, she allows that the newfound vulnerability critics praised in her 2008 portraits of aging affluent women arose from her feeling of kinship with her subjects. “It was scary how easy it was to become these women—those wrinkles in the neck, you know, they weren’t makeup,” she said with a laugh. “My thought about these women was that they were showing off their fantastic lives and wealth and yet couldn’t hide the price they had paid to get there. I could ­identify with being really successful and at the same time feeling like life isn’t always so perfect even when you think you have it all.”For her latest photographs, to be unveiled in April at New York’s Metro Pictures, Sherman had her pick of the Chanel ­archive, selecting the outfits from images sent to her by the famous fashion house. Once she made her choices, “they started sending me big coffinlike trunks stuffed like there was an invisible body inside of them.” It was her first experience wearing couture. “I didn’t want to take the hours it would take to do makeup,” she recalled, “because the clothes were so valuable and also pretty excruciating to wear, mostly because I couldn’t get them on.” Unable to zip up a beaded chiffon gown, she had to hold up the dress with one arm while she shot the picture with the other. “I was just so pissed because every time I’d go to pick up a mirror, the dress would fall off.

I’d been thinking about using makeup in a more extreme way, perhaps since the last two bodies of work (the Chanel series and the mural) didn’t involve any makeup at all, as I’d been tweaking the faces with Photoshop. As I was looking through a book about German Expressionist films and their stars, it all came together: Because of the extreme way actors made their faces up in those early day of film in order to pop out in the black-and-white. I just wanted to use makeup in the same way, partly perhaps because as women get older they’re told to wear less makeup. I loved the idea of doing the opposite.Did Sunset Boulevard have any influence on this series?Not directly, no. But lots of portraits of all the actresses from that time certainly did.Do you identify at all with the film stars you portray? Well, these women aren’t necessarily strictly films stars – I was really just thinking of portraits of women in the style of silent films. Unlike my \"Untitled Film Stills,\" these aren’t meant to be from films. I see some of them as portraits of CEOs, real estate moguls, or heiresses posing in front of or outside their domains.

How has your break since then influenced you?I’ve consistently had years in between series of work; this one was just slightly longer than most. I always need to get away from whatever it is I’ve just finished, to feel a distance from it. The working solo gets draining, too. And it wasn’t just a break without producing anything: I had two traveling museum shows, two other museum shows, catalogs for each, a project with Louis Vuitton, an appearance in a small film for an opera, etc.How has aging affected your portraits?Even though I’m disguised in my work, the makeup doesn’t hide the wrinkles and extra pockets of flab, and since I’ve been in front of the camera for 40 years, I see the difference.

I just wanted to use makeup in the same way, partly perhaps because as women get older they’re told to wear less makeup. I loved the idea of doing the opposite.How did you come to focus on 1920s cinema?Chanel seriesmuralDid Sunset Boulevard have any influence on this series?Not directly, no. But lots of portraits of all the actresses from that time certainly did.Did Sunset Boulevard have any influence on this series?Sunset BoulevardDo you identify at all with the film stars you portray? Well, these women aren’t necessarily strictly films stars – I was really just thinking of portraits of women in the style of silent films. Unlike my \"Untitled Film Stills,\" these aren’t meant to be from films. I see some of them as portraits of CEOs, real estate moguls, or heiresses posing in front of or outside their domains. My intention was to try to make flattering portraits of these women. I wanted pretty pictures of older women – women who are trying too hard but succeeding – pulling off an extreme look. What I didn’t know would creep into the portraits was a vulnerability behind the strong façade that most of them wear. They’ve maybe taken some wrong turns along the way, but they’re on the right track now. I identify with that.Do you identify at all with the film stars you portray?Untitled Film StillsYou last showed a new body of work in 2012. How has your break since then influenced you?I’ve consistently had years in between series of work; this one was just slightly longer than most. I always need to get away from whatever it is I’ve just finished, to feel a distance from it. The working solo gets draining, too. And it wasn’t just a break without producing anything: I had two traveling museum shows, two other museum shows, catalogs for each, a project with Louis Vuitton, an appearance in a small film for an opera, etc.You last showed a new body of work in 2012. How has your break since then influenced you?small film for an operaHow has aging affected your portraits?Even though I’m disguised in my work, the makeup doesn’t hide the wrinkles and extra pockets of flab, and since I’ve been in front of the camera for 40 years, I see the difference. And at my age, every five years makes a huge difference. My range of characters is more limited.How has aging affected your portraits?Watch W's most popular videos here:Watch W's most popular videos here:XCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsXCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsXXCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsCindy Sherman Is All the Golden GirlsCindy Sherman Is All the Golden Girls"

One work in particular, though, stuck out to Black—and to hordes of other online and IRL protestors who took to physically blocking it: Open Casket (2016), a canvas depicting the well-known photograph of the lifeless, mangled corpse of Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old who was lynched in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman.The artist, Dana Schutz, also happens to be a white woman, which is why Black accused her of \"transmut[ing] Black suffering into profit and fun,\" even if she set out to do so with good intentions. \"Those non-Black artists who sincerely wish to highlight the shameful nature of white violence should first of all stop treating Black pain as raw material,\" Black continued, eventually urging the biennial's curators, Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, to not only remove the painting from the exhibition, but also to destroy it.The pair did neither, though they did make (non-apologetic) statements of their own, meet with a protestor, organize a discussion attended by Claudia Rankine and Malia Obama, and append a statement written by Schutz next to the painting in the museum where the artist clarified that she never intended to sell Open Casket, and was instead approaching the photo, which Till's mother famously published in Jet magazine to \"let people seen what I've seen,\" from a parental perspective.

The biennial, long forgotten, has since been replaced by the pop-up beaches, parrots, and foam pits that make up Hélio Oiticica's tropical playground at the Whitney. Still, the controversy has returned this month, thanks to a new survey of Schutz's work at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, which—you guessed it—has already generated protests and calls to have it pulled and cancelled, most notably in an open letter by local artists, activists, and members of the community who accused the institution of capitalizing on Schutz's new notoriety, and of \"institutional backing of this type of violent artifact.\"To be clear, even though the show focuses on the last 10 years of Schutz's work, Open Casket is not and had never been part of the exhibition (it is addressed in a small portion of the show's wall text). And it should also be noted that the survey has been in the works long before the controversy at the Whitney. Still, to major art world names like Cindy Sherman, Marina Abramovic, Chuck Close, Kara Walker, and Ed Ruscha, disregarding all of Schutz's recent oeuvre just because of one recent transgression would amount to censorship—a view they, along with around 80 other members of the National Academy, made clear this week in an open letter declaring their \"unequivocal support\" for Schutz, whom they describe as being \"recently excoriated by a group of Boston artists.\"\"As fellow artists and architects, we wholeheartedly support cultural institutions like the ICA-Boston who refuse to bow to forces in favor of censorship or quelling dialogue,\" the letter continues. \"It is also of the utmost importance to us that artists not perpetrate upon each other the same kind of intolerance and tyranny that we criticize in others.\"The letter also supports the ICA's decision to \"maintain programming that fosters conversations between people with different points of view, especially given our current political climate of intolerance.\" (The museum has organized two talks and forums to address the controversy in September.)It's notable that several of the artists who signed the letter have lived down similar controversies. Marina Abramovic came under fire last year when she compared aboriginal Australians to dinosaurs in an early (later edited) version of her memoir.

Still, to major art world names like Cindy Sherman, Marina Abramovic, Chuck Close, Kara Walker, and Ed Ruscha, disregarding all of Schutz's recent oeuvre just because of one recent transgression would amount to censorship—a view they, along with around 80 other members of the National Academy, made clear this week in an open letter declaring their \"unequivocal support\" for Schutz, whom they describe as being \"recently excoriated by a group of Boston artists.\"\"As fellow artists and architects, we wholeheartedly support cultural institutions like the ICA-Boston who refuse to bow to forces in favor of censorship or quelling dialogue,\" the letter continues. \"It is also of the utmost importance to us that artists not perpetrate upon each other the same kind of intolerance and tyranny that we criticize in others.\"The letter also supports the ICA's decision to \"maintain programming that fosters conversations between people with different points of view, especially given our current political climate of intolerance.\" (The museum has organized two talks and forums to address the controversy in September.)It's notable that several of the artists who signed the letter have lived down similar controversies. Marina Abramovic came under fire last year when she compared aboriginal Australians to dinosaurs in an early (later edited) version of her memoir. Cindy Sherman, as beloved as she is these days—the mere act of making her Instagram public this week practically broke the internet—once survived \"#CindyGate,\" after the internet dug up some of her earliest self-portraits, at age 22, in which she posed in black-face. Even a black artist like Kara Walker, who is famous for tackling slavery and racism in her work, is not immune to social critics; she was once was the target of the black artist Betye Saar's letter-writing campaign to censor and destroy her work back in 1999.Related: The Protests and Reactions to Dana Schutz's Painting of Emmett Till in the 2017 Whitney BiennialSee Kendall Jenner, Performance Artist, Channel Icons Like Marina Abramovic and Yoko Ono:Earlier this year, the artist Hannah Black practically tore the art world apart when she published an open letter on Tumblr attacking the 2017 Whitney Biennial, which at that point had been widely praised for its brazen embrace of politics. One work in particular, though, stuck out to Black—and to hordes of other online and IRL protestors who took to physically blocking it: Open Casket (2016), a canvas depicting the well-known photograph of the lifeless, mangled corpse of Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old who was lynched in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman.The artist, Dana Schutz, also happens to be a white woman, which is why Black accused her of \"transmut[ing] Black suffering into profit and fun,\" even if she set out to do so with good intentions. \"Those non-Black artists who sincerely wish to highlight the shameful nature of white violence should first of all stop treating Black pain as raw material,\" Black continued, eventually urging the biennial's curators, Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, to not only remove the painting from the exhibition, but also to destroy it.The pair did neither, though they did make (non-apologetic) statements of their own, meet with a protestor, organize a discussion attended by Claudia Rankine and Malia Obama, and append a statement written by Schutz next to the painting in the museum where the artist clarified that she never intended to sell Open Casket, and was instead approaching the photo, which Till's mother famously published in Jet magazine to \"let people seen what I've seen,\" from a parental perspective. (\"I don’t know what it is like to be black in America but I do know what it is like to be a mother,\" she told the New York Times, before further explaining her reasoning in a conveniently timely New Yorker profile.)Fast-forward five months later. The biennial, long forgotten, has since been replaced by the pop-up beaches, parrots, and foam pits that make up Hélio Oiticica's tropical playground at the Whitney.

        "description": "I'm at the Cindy Sherman opening at Metro Pictures. Jerry Saltz is here too. I know who he is because I've read some of his articles. I know what he looks like because of that television show he's on, the art competition, and even though I haven't seen it, I have seen a still from the show in which Saltz's right eyebrow is raised and his head is tipped with critical suggestiveness. At the gallery tonight, he's having a private conversation when a photographer approaches him to snap a picture. Saltz flashes a quick peace sign and goes right back to his conversation. The move has the whiff of a well-timed cultural ritual, the photographer and Saltz engaged in a smooth, effortless choreography.",

        "text": "The Cindy Sherman photos, on the other hand, have been Photoshopped and manipulated and they don’t try to hide it. Sherman looks like she’s separate from these painted landscapes. She’s in the photo but she’s definitely on top of the backgrounds. And even though the women in the photos have vague relationships to their landscapes, there’s something wrong about the correlation. The connections aren’t real, and the photos are constantly reminding you of that. It’s different from the way Jerry Saltz flashed the peace sign at the camera. Whereas maybe that single action was rehearsed, or habitual, or staged, you couldn’t call the photo inauthentic. Saltz isn’t controlling the photo. All he’s doing is flashing a peace sign (and a smile!): Everything else is up to chance. Like, I noticed how the photographer made the choice to shoot Saltz from a lower angle, which could lead to the double chin effect that lower camera angles encourage—something I’m sure Saltz did not intend. Also, whatever bystander happened to wander behind Saltz is now dragged into the picture. Saltz might not identify with this person, but he is forever linked to them in the Internet’s photo archive. Or maybe one of Saltz’s eyelids is half-closed, giving him that confused/bored/ill expression.Each one of the Shermans, on the other hand, has a perfect expression.

Sherman in her role-playing self-portraiture has done what might be the riskiest thing possible for a woman of our time (or any time, I’d wager): she has made herself look consistently awful in public, and for nearly four decades now. There she is, again and again, hiding behind spackle-like make-up and prosthetics, frump and fright wigs, lumpy costumes and swollen rubber breasts. She means to disturb, to detonate.Her work is about many different things at once, which is why it’s good, but one thing it’s almost always about, whether Sherman is subverting pin-up poses or dissecting the vanities of middle- and upper-class portraiture, is women’s bodies: the way they present themselves to the world, and the way they are commoditized, coveted, abhorred by others—i.e., “the construction of female identity, established through visual codes like dress, hair, and makeup,” as MoMA’s catalog puts it, employing a language, Artspeak, not yet recognized by Google translate. Another Sherman subject: femininity “as an erotic construct and fetish of the male gaze”—i.e., my own translation, hotness.As brilliant, ground-breaking, and still provocative as many of Sherman’s pictures are, I found the show uneven. Seen en masse, there’s a consistent intensity but also a sameness to the work, like a record where all the songs are at the same speed and pitch. It’s a good speed and pitch; you just want some modulation. Sherman might be an artist better stumbled upon piecemeal, by surprise, her images knocking you upside the head when you’re not expecting an impact. Someone should have some fun and go guerilla, take her pictures off the walls, and slip them into magazines and family photo albums—art by ambush.But that’s an issue common to many museum shows, or at least those with some claim on upsetting social norms: the old preaching-to-the-choir problem. Which is how I’ll segue to Lena Dunham, whose smart, painful, and funny half-hour HBO comedy Girls has three more episodes to run before completing its first season. Dunham—in case you’re a first-time visitor to this Web site—writes, stars, and often directs this series about twenty-somethings groping their way toward adulthood in what pass for affordable, artist-friendly neighborhoods in Brooklyn. (Juli Weiner’s excellent recaps are here.)Dunham’s concerns are entirely different from Sherman’s, but working for HBO, instead of for galleries and art magazines, she has been doing more than her fair share of visual-code subverting and male-gaze punking by A) frequently appearing naked on her show and B) being overweight and not particularly shapely. Context: Girls is preceded each Sunday evening by Game of Thrones, which features at least one gratuitous, model-perfect female disrobing per episode. The show also asks us to believe that medieval grooming standards adhered to 21st-century tastes.Dunham, meanwhile, tacitly asks us to accept her less-than-perfect body and desire it, or accept that men on the show desire it, even if her character has a nasty self-loathing streak, and even if her weight is the butt of jokes, her own and others’. (“She doesn’t look like Camryn Manheim,” snaps her gay ex-boyfriend’s new boyfriend after meeting her in the season finale.) I’ve had both men and women tell me Dunham’s nudity makes them not want to watch the show—it “creeps them out,” to borrow a phrase—which is sad on so many levels. Even fans invariably say her nude scenes are “brave,” an admiring but also condescending adjective they would never use for Halle Berry’s nude scenes.So is this the most transgressive thing a female artist can do in 2012: be fat, naked, and unashamed on TV? I’d love to see some kind of collaboration between Dunham and Sherman, on either woman’s turf. (I wonder if they’re fans of each other’s.) All the same, you could add Dunham and Sherman and multiply the result by a thousand and, in terms of cultural noise, you still wouldn’t get Beyoncé, whose concerts last weekend at Atlantic City, judging from the reviews and news coverage, were primarily conceived to celebrate the fact that she’d lost her baby weight and returned to presentability. “She first appeared in a silhouette, focusing on her middle section, which is back in action,” observedThe New York Times on Monday. The next day a Google search for “post baby body” turned up 572 news articles.Nothing against Beyoncé, though: no one really expects her to get radical with her visual codes. But how about supposed dare-devils such as Madonna or Lady Gaga? Maybe they could eat a few Doritos, or stop shaving their armpits?

Sherman might be an artist better stumbled upon piecemeal, by surprise, her images knocking you upside the head when you’re not expecting an impact. Someone should have some fun and go guerilla, take her pictures off the walls, and slip them into magazines and family photo albums—art by ambush.But that’s an issue common to many museum shows, or at least those with some claim on upsetting social norms: the old preaching-to-the-choir problem. Which is how I’ll segue to Lena Dunham, whose smart, painful, and funny half-hour HBO comedy Girls has three more episodes to run before completing its first season. Dunham—in case you’re a first-time visitor to this Web site—writes, stars, and often directs this series about twenty-somethings groping their way toward adulthood in what pass for affordable, artist-friendly neighborhoods in Brooklyn. (Juli Weiner’s excellent recaps are here.)Girlsexcellent recaps are hereDunham’s concerns are entirely different from Sherman’s, but working for HBO, instead of for galleries and art magazines, she has been doing more than her fair share of visual-code subverting and male-gaze punking by A) frequently appearing naked on her show and B) being overweight and not particularly shapely. Context: Girls is preceded each Sunday evening by Game of Thrones, which features at least one gratuitous, model-perfect female disrobing per episode. The show also asks us to believe that medieval grooming standards adhered to 21st-century tastes.GirlsGame of ThronesDunham, meanwhile, tacitly asks us to accept her less-than-perfect body and desire it, or accept that men on the show desire it, even if her character has a nasty self-loathing streak, and even if her weight is the butt of jokes, her own and others’. (“She doesn’t look like Camryn Manheim,” snaps her gay ex-boyfriend’s new boyfriend after meeting her in the season finale.) I’ve had both men and women tell me Dunham’s nudity makes them not want to watch the show—it “creeps them out,” to borrow a phrase—which is sad on so many levels. Even fans invariably say her nude scenes are “brave,” an admiring but also condescending adjective they would never use for Halle Berry’s nude scenes.So is this the most transgressive thing a female artist can do in 2012: be fat, naked, and unashamed on TV? I’d love to see some kind of collaboration between Dunham and Sherman, on either woman’s turf. (I wonder if they’re fans of each other’s.) All the same, you could add Dunham and Sherman and multiply the result by a thousand and, in terms of cultural noise, you still wouldn’t get Beyoncé, whose concerts last weekend at Atlantic City, judging from the reviews and news coverage, were primarily conceived to celebrate the fact that she’d lost her baby weight and returned to presentability. “She first appeared in a silhouette, focusing on her middle section, which is back in action,” observedThe New York Times on Monday. The next day a Google search for “post baby body” turned up 572 news articles.The New York TimesNothing against Beyoncé, though: no one really expects her to get radical with her visual codes. But how about supposed dare-devils such as Madonna or Lady Gaga? Maybe they could eat a few Doritos, or stop shaving their armpits? That might fuck with some male gazes."

(Said institution is so discreet, it refuses to have its name mentioned in coverage of the event.) Then again, the theme of night, which honored Carolina Herrera and writer Linda Yablonsky, was “White Glove Gone Wild Gala” and the dress code of “glove and gown for ladies, jacket and tie for gents” was loosely interpreted by many.“We wanted to do a benefit outside all the other benefits and we wanted to have a spring break [theme]. So we started thinking about beer kegs and t-shirts and girls gone wild,” explained Doreen Remen, APF’s co-founder with Yvonne Force Villareal. When a friend introduced them to said anonymous club, it was a sealed deal. “We thought, oh my god, we have to do it, but it’s so white glove! And then we said, we’re literally white glove gone wild. What is white glove? It’s the highest, the best, the most, the uber. And that’s what our work is. It’s just gone wild.”And so alongside women like the co-chairs Fabiola Beracasa, Renee Rockefeller, Allison Sarofim and Cindy Sherman, was emcee Donna D’Cruz in a Carolina Herrera look accessorized with copious face paint and a Venetian mask-cum-crown; Stacy Engman in a dress, by the artist Rachel Mason, that looked as though she had taken a hammer to a mirror; and many a tux-clad lady proudly bucking the gown mandate. Dita Von Teese mingled with “Glee” star Dianna Agron and Emmy Rossum. Female servers passed trays of mini potatoes with caviar and cheeseburgers. And the Dom Perignon champagne was served in coupes the size of a generous martini glass.Marilyn Minter took over a small room near the front where she took wet-glass portraits of select guests. There was a live auction of works by Jeff Koons (whose “Dom Perignon Balloon Venus” went to Gigi Mortimer for more than twice its auction estimate of $20,000), Enoc Perez and Ugo Rondinone. On the second floor, Vanessa Beecroft set up an installation, VB73, a tableau of women like Frederique van der Wal and Amy Sacco, fully clothed—it was an Upper East Side club, after all—in an array of period dress paired with wigs. “I’m feeling judged,” said one young woman, as the group stared blank-faced at passersby.Back downstairs in another room, a slew of volunteers were applying temporary tattoos designed by the artist Wangechi Mutu, whose motifs included a suggestive pout and the phrase “I’ve been trying so hard to be feline.”“I wonder what Carolina Herrera will think of these!” mused one guest.She had her answer later during cocktails.“I would like a CH!” proclaimed the designer (unfortunately, no such design was available).“For me, it’s not strange because I always wear white gloves,” said the designers of the evening’s theme. “They are made to order. Because they have to fit you perfectly.”And would Mrs. Herrera be partaking of the second part of the dictate, by going wild?“What do you mean? I get naked or what? What do you mean wild?” she said with mock indignation and a laugh. “I’m dressed up already. I cannot be wild. I should have come in something else, maybe.”To the contrary, she looked perfect, as always.XPhotos: White Gloves Gone WildSlide 1 of 18PreviousNextConsidering that Art Production Fund’s (APF) past public projects have included a Marco Brambilla video installation at the Time Warner Center and the projection of a Ryan McGinley work, “Varúò,” which follows a barefoot young woman traipsing through Manhattan, onto the billboards of Times Square, it might seem curious that the non-profit chose a seemingly stuffy private Upper East Side club as the site of its spring gala Wednesday evening.

I set about trying to collate all of my experiences over the years of owning a backpack. I wanted to concentrate all of the features that I love and try and put them into the piece. making the thing stand up for example was very important, I hate when you wear a backpack, take it off and it just falls over. this bag has a structure inside to enable it to stand. the design process has seen newson working on a plush yet study accessory ‘I wanted to explore the monogram functional qualities.’ he says of the iconic louis vuitton emblem ‘if you go back to the reason why the monogram canvas was invented, it’s because it’s durable and it’s weather proof. in the bag it performs a very specific function; I deliberately used it around the base so it almost became like a tyre on a car, or a sole on a shoe. obviously you still see it, but it has a purpose. I wanted it to be fun as well — I don’t like when things take themselves too seriously. I want objects that put a smile on people’s faces, make them laugh and question their own seriousness. I used a textile that juxtaposed the utility of the monogram with something more light-hearted, that’s why I chose to use the furry sheepskin. it’s cuddly and warm and comes in bright colors, but it is also durable and like a pillow; if I ever want to prop the bag up and have a snooze I can.’frank gehry’s sculptural handbag for louis vuitton frank gehry has applied his architectural mastery to the construction of a sculptural handbag in monogram canvas. the twisted box has been the most technically challenging piece of the collection, due to its union of both rigid lines and and curves. a press of the golden-brass clasp reveals a blue lambskin interior, embossed with a hand-drawn monogram pattern.the handbag in its prototype phase frank gehry on the design of his sculptural handbag: ‘I didn’t want it to be just ‘a thing,’ so I spent time with louis vuitton to talk about the refinement of details, the clasp, the whole of it. I have had fun with them, we have been changing and refining the bag up until the last minute. they take craftsmanship very seriously at louis vuitton and that’s what I like. I hand drew the monogram for the embossed interior. I have never really been inside a handbag, so I was trying to think what I would like if i was inside, I thought ‘maybe blue.’ I just liked that colour in contrast with the brown monogram. I wanted to leave the attention on the outside. the interior is more private, and a darker blue just felt more orderly somehow, that it would give the things in the bag more clarity. I suppose I just have a fantasy of what it would be like to be inside the bag!’gehry is photographed (left) with his design by karl lagerfeld(right) the architect works on the design of his bag with a team of creatorsthe design by cindy sherman sherman has reimagined the custom-made vuitton trunk, covered in a monogram canvas. the trunk is fitted with a vanity case, a camera messenger bag and a total of 31 colorful drawers.(left) cindy sherman and her design / photo by karl lagerfeld(right) the colorful boxes can accommodate large and small treasures on her influences for the trunk’s vibrant interior, sherman says: ‘I was asked about the color scheme; what was my favorite color? it was then I thought about my parrot. my parrot is this iridescent green and there are all of these other colors when he spreads his wings; this became the color scheme for the interior. I thought it would be really nice if the outside of the trunk looked old, like it had traveled around the world with all of these stickers on the monogram. we decided to use some of my images for the stickers, but to push them and make them more bizarre. all of it was just so much fun to do!’karl lagerfeld’s boxing suite for louis vuitton in celebration of vuitton’s iconic monogram canvas, karl lagerfeld has imagined an extravagant set of luggage and accessories, fitted with a signature punching bag and stand, while a separate suitcase, also in monogram, holds boxing gloves and a mat. with its capacious interior and removable shelving, the trunk can also serve as a travel closet.sketches by karl lagerfeld karl lagerfeld on the design of his boxing suite set: ‘I know more and more women—and men too—who have started to box. I thought it was something that one should do, if possible, in a very expensive way. so I designed the huge piece of luggage with the punching-ball in it.

        "text": "“Wow, wow, wow.” Cindy Sherman, dressed in head-to-toe black, all the way down to her Chanel biker boots, is sitting inside Anna Hu’s glitzy boutique at New York’s Plaza Hotel—far from her usual stomping grounds. She’s so awestruck, she’s on the verge of tears. The story begins this past May at the annual Creative Time art benefit, where Sherman, who would be the first to tell you that she’s hardly a fine jewelry aficionada, was taken with Melva Bucksbaum’s million-dollar necklace—a gigantic lotus-flower stunner, encrusted with pink diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds, designed by Hu. “That’s the first time I heard of Anna,” recalls Sherman. Turns out, one of the evening’s items up for auction was an opportunity to collaborate with Hu on a custom creation. Sherman went for it: “I shot my hand up, taking a chance but assuming that I’d be outbid.” She was, by art connoisseur Amy Phelan, to the tune of $15,000. But when word circulated that Sherman was the underbidder, Hu—who had ardently followed the photographer’s work while studying for master’s degrees at Parsons and Columbia—said she would be honored to make a second piece with Sherman. The next day Sherman matched Phelan’s bid.Two months later, they got started. Hu showed Sherman her collection, which she launched in 2006 and divides into two categories, Western contemporary and Oriental traditionalism. Sherman was drawn to the latter, especially Hu’s fantastical snake, dragon, and frog gems. “I am a fan of insects, reptiles, and mushrooms—things from nature,” says Sherman. As for Hu, snakes are one of her favorite motifs. “In the Egyptian culture, the snake is the goddess of jewelry and the goddess of fortune,” says the jeweler, who was introduced to precious stones as a child in Taiwan by her diamond-dealer father. “It’s almost equivalent to the dragon in Chinese culture.” With that the plan was hatched: a bracelet-ring combo connected by two intertwined serpents, one in 18-karat yellow gold and the other in 18-karat white gold, both set in five carats of white, black, and yellow diamonds and garnets and dotted with pigeon-blood rubies for the eyes. (It goes without saying that the initial $15,000 grew into a much pricier commission.) The bauble is held together by an onyx and mother-of-pearl yin-yang symbol, as well as by seven flexible joints that allow the piece to bend with the knuckles. “If this was made in a jewelry house, it would take at least eight months,” explains Hu. “But I had five French artisans working late into the night to finish it.” (And just in the nick of time—it was completed at 5 a.m. the day of this story’s photo shoot.)Back to the “wows” at the Plaza, where Sherman is still gazing at the new bling wrapped around her wrist and index finger. “It’s like having a little gorgeous pet,” she says. “It almost seems alive. I couldn’t be more thrilled.” So thrilled that the downtown minimalist has turned into a bona fide diamond devotee?“I think it’s too precious to wear all the time,” notes Sherman. “My friends will think I’ve gone completely uptown if I start wearing jewels during the day, although I do love the idea—perhaps when I’m in my 70s.”“Wow, wow, wow.” Cindy Sherman, dressed in head-to-toe black, all the way down to her Chanel biker boots, is sitting inside Anna Hu’s glitzy boutique at New York’s Plaza Hotel—far from her usual stomping grounds.

        "text": "Cynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits.In 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.[1] In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.[2] She Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression.Early life and education[edit]Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman.[3][4][5] Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft.[6] Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.[7].In 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing.[8] Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\"[9] Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\"[10] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms.[11] At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties.[12] This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.[8]In 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.[13]It was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.[14] Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.[15]Photography[edit]Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.[16]Early work[edit]Bus Riders (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Margo Jefferson on the bus riders series: \"a series of 15 black-and-white photographs from 1976 in which she impersonates black and white bus riders. They are male and female, young and aging; they are street kids, workers and yuppies. But the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"Other early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.In her landmark photograph series, the Untitled Film Stills, (1977–80), Sherman appeared as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”Many of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".\"I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\"[17]She explained to the New York Times in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”Untitled Film Stills[edit]The series Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors),[18] producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.[19] She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity.[20] She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society.[8] Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.[21] Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment. The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups: The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4). The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo in 1976 and began a relationship with him)[22] Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21 Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979))[13] She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father[23] at sunset one evening during the trip. The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.[24] The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan purchased the series for an estimated $1 million in 1995.[25]1980s[edit]In addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms—the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s Fairy Tales and Disasters sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.[citation needed]It was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine.[26] She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine.[27] About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”[10]In 1982, Sherman began her Pink Robes series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.[28]In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time.[19] Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series,[23] Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.[citation needed]Between 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title History Portraits.[29][30]1990s[edit]Sex Pictures[edit]Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” [31] Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” [32] Reviewer Jerry Saltz told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.”[33] Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color.[34]With her Sex Pictures, Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon[35]2000s[edit]Between 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.Her exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11)[36] accompanied by films selected by Sherman.[37] Based on a 32-page insert[38] Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.[39]In 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\".[40] Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.[41]Fashion[edit]Sherman’s career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs.[42] In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine.[43] Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in Harper's Bazaar in 1993.[44] In 1994, she produced the Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.[citation needed]In 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga) in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010.[45] Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.[46]Music and films[edit]In the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums Fontanelle and Painkillers, creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\"[47] She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie Office Killer in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman and has a shared interest with arranging bodies and is like a puppeteer and arranges her own dioramas.[48][page needed] According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, Office Killer is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece.[48] The film got mixed reviews. In a review for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" [49] Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" [50] Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film Pecker, and also appeared in The Feature in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award.[citation needed] Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her Untitled Horror series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. Office Killer grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"[51]In the catalog essay[52] by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to Office Killer being created. The catalog also includes a conversation between Sherman and the director of the exhibit, Sofia Coppola, in which Sherman admits that she may star in an upcoming film project.[50]Exhibitions[edit]Sherman's first solo show in New York was presented at a noncommercial space called the Kitchen in 1980. When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show.[53] “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist.[23]Sherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2006), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman’s work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007). In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show \"The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[54]In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art mounted “Cindy Sherman,” a show that chronicled Sherman's work from the mid-1970s on and include more than 170 photographs. The exhibition travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.[55] In 2013, Sherman was invited to organize a show within that year's Venice Biennale.[56]In 2016, after a sabbatical from her studio which was spent \"coming to terms with health issues and getting older,\" Sherman produced and staged her first photo gallery in five years. The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.[57][58]Collections[edit]Works by Sherman are held in the following collection: The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59] Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NY Feminism[edit]Sherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series Centerfolds contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series Society Pictures addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 Imitation of Life, explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.[57]When writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal October, the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\" [60]However, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"[61]Many scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's Untitled series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.[62]Others question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's,[63][64] and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.Sherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"[65]In addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster[66] and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like Vomit Pictures as de-fetishizing the female body.[62]Scholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.[67]Recognition[edit]In 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York.[68] In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships.[citation needed] This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work. Among her awards are the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (1993);[citation needed] Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1997);[citation needed] Hasselblad Award (1999);[citation needed] Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Arts (2005);[citation needed] American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award (2003);[citation needed] National Arts Award (2001);[citation needed] Jewish Museum’s Man Ray Award (2009);[69] and the Roswitha Haftmann Prize (2012).[citation needed] In 2010, Sherman was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.[citation needed] She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.[2]At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2012, Sherman was honored by actor Steve Martin.[70] In 2012, Sherman was among the artists whose works were given as trophies to the filmmakers of winning pictures in the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival's jury competitions.[71]Art market[edit]In 2010, Sherman’s nearly six foot tall chromogenic color print Untitled #153 (1985), featuring the artist as a mudcaked corpse, was sold by Phillips de Pury & Company for a record $2.7 million, near the $3 million high estimate.[72] In 2011, a print of Untitled #96 fetched $3.89 million at Christie's, making it the most expensive photograph at that time.[73]Influence[edit]Sherman's work is often credited as a major influence for contemporary portrait photographers.[74] One such photographer is Ryan Trecartin, who manipulates themes of identity in his videos and photography.[75]In April 2014, actor and artist James Franco exhibited a series of photographs at the Pace Gallery called New Film Stills, in which Franco restaged twenty-nine images from Sherman's Untitled Film Stills.[76] The exhibit garnered mainly negative reviews, calling Franco's appropriations 'sophomoric,' 'sexist,' and embarrassingly clueless.'[77][78]Personal life[edit]Sherman married director Michel Auder in 1984, making her stepmother to Auder's daughter, Alexandra, and her half-sister Gaby Hoffmann.[79] They divorced in 1999.[80] From 2007 to 2011, she had a relationship with the artist David Byrne.[81] Between 1991 and 2005,[82] she lived in a fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood; she later sold it to actor Hank Azaria.[83] She bought two floors in a 10-story condo building overlooking the Hudson River in West Soho,[38][82] and today uses one as her apartment and the other as her studio and office.[84]Sherman long spent her summers in Catskill Mountains.[85] In 2000, she bought songwriter Marvin Hamlisch's[85] 4,200-square-foot house on 0.4 acre in Sag Harbor for $1.5 million.[86] She later acquired a 19th-century home on a ten-acre waterfront[87] property on Accabonac Harbor in East Hampton, New York.[88][89]Sherman serves on the artistic advisory committee of the New York City-based Stephen Petronio Company.[90] Along with David Byrne, she was a member of Portugal's Estoril Film Festival's jury in 2009.[91]In 2012, she joined Yoko Ono and nearly 150 fellow artists in the founding of Artists Against Fracking, a group in opposition to hydraulic fracturing to remove gas from underground deposits.[92]Sherman has expressed contempt for social media platforms, calling them \"so vulgar.\" [50]Controversy[edit]Sherman has been criticized for her early Bus Riders series (1976–2000).[93] American Theatre critic Margo Jefferson has written, \"[The African-American figures] all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"[94]Books[edit] Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman.

Cynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits.In 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.[1] In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.[2] She Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression.Early life and education[edit]Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman.[3][4][5] Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft.[6] Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.[7].In 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing.[8] Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\"[9] Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\"[10] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms.[11] At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties.[12] This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.[8]In 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.[13]It was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.[14] Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.[15]Photography[edit]Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.[16]Early work[edit]Bus Riders (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Margo Jefferson on the bus riders series: \"a series of 15 black-and-white photographs from 1976 in which she impersonates black and white bus riders. They are male and female, young and aging; they are street kids, workers and yuppies. But the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"Other early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.In her landmark photograph series, the Untitled Film Stills, (1977–80), Sherman appeared as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”Many of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".\"I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\"[17]She explained to the New York Times in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”Untitled Film Stills[edit]The series Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors),[18] producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.[19] She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity.[20] She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society.[8] Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.[21] Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment. The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups: The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4). The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo in 1976 and began a relationship with him)[22] Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21 Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979))[13] She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father[23] at sunset one evening during the trip. The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.[24] The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan purchased the series for an estimated $1 million in 1995.[25]1980s[edit]In addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms—the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s Fairy Tales and Disasters sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.[citation needed]It was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine.[26] She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine.[27] About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”[10]In 1982, Sherman began her Pink Robes series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.[28]In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time.[19] Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series,[23] Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.[citation needed]Between 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title History Portraits.[29][30]1990s[edit]Sex Pictures[edit]Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” [31] Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” [32] Reviewer Jerry Saltz told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.”[33] Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color.[34]With her Sex Pictures, Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon[35]2000s[edit]Between 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.Her exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11)[36] accompanied by films selected by Sherman.[37] Based on a 32-page insert[38] Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.[39]In 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\".[40] Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.[41]Fashion[edit]Sherman’s career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs.[42] In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine.[43] Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in Harper's Bazaar in 1993.[44] In 1994, she produced the Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.[citation needed]In 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga) in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010.[45] Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.[46]Music and films[edit]In the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums Fontanelle and Painkillers, creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\"[47] She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie Office Killer in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman and has a shared interest with arranging bodies and is like a puppeteer and arranges her own dioramas.[48][page needed] According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, Office Killer is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece.[48] The film got mixed reviews. In a review for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" [49] Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" [50] Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film Pecker, and also appeared in The Feature in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award.[citation needed] Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her Untitled Horror series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. Office Killer grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"[51]In the catalog essay[52] by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to Office Killer being created. The catalog also includes a conversation between Sherman and the director of the exhibit, Sofia Coppola, in which Sherman admits that she may star in an upcoming film project.[50]Exhibitions[edit]Sherman's first solo show in New York was presented at a noncommercial space called the Kitchen in 1980. When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show.[53] “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist.[23]Sherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2006), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman’s work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007). In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show \"The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[54]In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art mounted “Cindy Sherman,” a show that chronicled Sherman's work from the mid-1970s on and include more than 170 photographs. The exhibition travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.[55] In 2013, Sherman was invited to organize a show within that year's Venice Biennale.[56]In 2016, after a sabbatical from her studio which was spent \"coming to terms with health issues and getting older,\" Sherman produced and staged her first photo gallery in five years. The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.[57][58]Collections[edit]Works by Sherman are held in the following collection: The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59] Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NY Feminism[edit]Sherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series Centerfolds contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series Society Pictures addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 Imitation of Life, explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.[57]When writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal October, the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\" [60]However, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"[61]Many scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's Untitled series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.[62]Others question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's,[63][64] and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.Sherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"[65]In addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster[66] and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like Vomit Pictures as de-fetishizing the female body.[62]Scholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.[67]Recognition[edit]In 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York.[68] In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships.[citation needed] This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work. Among her awards are the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (1993);[citation needed] Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1997);[citation needed] Hasselblad Award (1999);[citation needed] Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Arts (2005);[citation needed] American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award (2003);[citation needed] National Arts Award (2001);[citation needed] Jewish Museum’s Man Ray Award (2009);[69] and the Roswitha Haftmann Prize (2012).[citation needed] In 2010, Sherman was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.[citation needed] She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.[2]At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2012, Sherman was honored by actor Steve Martin.[70] In 2012, Sherman was among the artists whose works were given as trophies to the filmmakers of winning pictures in the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival's jury competitions.[71]Art market[edit]In 2010, Sherman’s nearly six foot tall chromogenic color print Untitled #153 (1985), featuring the artist as a mudcaked corpse, was sold by Phillips de Pury & Company for a record $2.7 million, near the $3 million high estimate.[72] In 2011, a print of Untitled #96 fetched $3.89 million at Christie's, making it the most expensive photograph at that time.[73]Influence[edit]Sherman's work is often credited as a major influence for contemporary portrait photographers.[74] One such photographer is Ryan Trecartin, who manipulates themes of identity in his videos and photography.[75]In April 2014, actor and artist James Franco exhibited a series of photographs at the Pace Gallery called New Film Stills, in which Franco restaged twenty-nine images from Sherman's Untitled Film Stills.[76] The exhibit garnered mainly negative reviews, calling Franco's appropriations 'sophomoric,' 'sexist,' and embarrassingly clueless.'[77][78]Personal life[edit]Sherman married director Michel Auder in 1984, making her stepmother to Auder's daughter, Alexandra, and her half-sister Gaby Hoffmann.[79] They divorced in 1999.[80] From 2007 to 2011, she had a relationship with the artist David Byrne.[81] Between 1991 and 2005,[82] she lived in a fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood; she later sold it to actor Hank Azaria.[83] She bought two floors in a 10-story condo building overlooking the Hudson River in West Soho,[38][82] and today uses one as her apartment and the other as her studio and office.[84]Sherman long spent her summers in Catskill Mountains.[85] In 2000, she bought songwriter Marvin Hamlisch's[85] 4,200-square-foot house on 0.4 acre in Sag Harbor for $1.5 million.[86] She later acquired a 19th-century home on a ten-acre waterfront[87] property on Accabonac Harbor in East Hampton, New York.[88][89]Sherman serves on the artistic advisory committee of the New York City-based Stephen Petronio Company.[90] Along with David Byrne, she was a member of Portugal's Estoril Film Festival's jury in 2009.[91]In 2012, she joined Yoko Ono and nearly 150 fellow artists in the founding of Artists Against Fracking, a group in opposition to hydraulic fracturing to remove gas from underground deposits.[92]Sherman has expressed contempt for social media platforms, calling them \"so vulgar.\" [50]Controversy[edit]Sherman has been criticized for her early Bus Riders series (1976–2000).[93] American Theatre critic Margo Jefferson has written, \"[The African-American figures] all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"[94]Books[edit] Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman.

Cynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits.In 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.[1] In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.[2] She Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression.Early life and education[edit]Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman.[3][4][5] Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft.[6] Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.[7].In 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing.[8] Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\"[9] Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\"[10] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms.[11] At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties.[12] This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.[8]In 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.[13]It was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.[14] Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.[15]Photography[edit]Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.[16]Early work[edit]Bus Riders (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Margo Jefferson on the bus riders series: \"a series of 15 black-and-white photographs from 1976 in which she impersonates black and white bus riders. They are male and female, young and aging; they are street kids, workers and yuppies. But the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"Other early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.In her landmark photograph series, the Untitled Film Stills, (1977–80), Sherman appeared as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”Many of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".\"I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\"[17]She explained to the New York Times in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”Untitled Film Stills[edit]The series Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors),[18] producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.[19] She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity.[20] She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society.[8] Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.[21] Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment. The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups: The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4). The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo in 1976 and began a relationship with him)[22] Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21 Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979))[13] She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father[23] at sunset one evening during the trip. The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.[24] The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan purchased the series for an estimated $1 million in 1995.[25]1980s[edit]In addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms—the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s Fairy Tales and Disasters sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.[citation needed]It was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine.[26] She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine.[27] About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”[10]In 1982, Sherman began her Pink Robes series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.[28]In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time.[19] Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series,[23] Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.[citation needed]Between 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title History Portraits.[29][30]1990s[edit]Sex Pictures[edit]Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” [31] Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” [32] Reviewer Jerry Saltz told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.”[33] Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color.[34]With her Sex Pictures, Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon[35]2000s[edit]Between 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.Her exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11)[36] accompanied by films selected by Sherman.[37] Based on a 32-page insert[38] Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.[39]In 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\".[40] Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.[41]Fashion[edit]Sherman’s career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs.[42] In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine.[43] Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in Harper's Bazaar in 1993.[44] In 1994, she produced the Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.[citation needed]In 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga) in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010.[45] Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.[46]Music and films[edit]In the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums Fontanelle and Painkillers, creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\"[47] She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie Office Killer in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman and has a shared interest with arranging bodies and is like a puppeteer and arranges her own dioramas.[48][page needed] According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, Office Killer is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece.[48] The film got mixed reviews. In a review for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" [49] Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" [50] Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film Pecker, and also appeared in The Feature in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award.[citation needed] Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her Untitled Horror series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. Office Killer grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"[51]In the catalog essay[52] by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to Office Killer being created. The catalog also includes a conversation between Sherman and the director of the exhibit, Sofia Coppola, in which Sherman admits that she may star in an upcoming film project.[50]Exhibitions[edit]Sherman's first solo show in New York was presented at a noncommercial space called the Kitchen in 1980. When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show.[53] “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist.[23]Sherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2006), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman’s work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007). In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show \"The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[54]In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art mounted “Cindy Sherman,” a show that chronicled Sherman's work from the mid-1970s on and include more than 170 photographs. The exhibition travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.[55] In 2013, Sherman was invited to organize a show within that year's Venice Biennale.[56]In 2016, after a sabbatical from her studio which was spent \"coming to terms with health issues and getting older,\" Sherman produced and staged her first photo gallery in five years. The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.[57][58]Collections[edit]Works by Sherman are held in the following collection: The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59] Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NY Feminism[edit]Sherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series Centerfolds contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series Society Pictures addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 Imitation of Life, explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.[57]When writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal October, the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\" [60]However, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"[61]Many scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's Untitled series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.[62]Others question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's,[63][64] and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.Sherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"[65]In addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster[66] and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like Vomit Pictures as de-fetishizing the female body.[62]Scholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.[67]Recognition[edit]In 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York.[68] In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships.[citation needed] This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work. Among her awards are the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (1993);[citation needed] Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1997);[citation needed] Hasselblad Award (1999);[citation needed] Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Arts (2005);[citation needed] American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award (2003);[citation needed] National Arts Award (2001);[citation needed] Jewish Museum’s Man Ray Award (2009);[69] and the Roswitha Haftmann Prize (2012).[citation needed] In 2010, Sherman was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.[citation needed] She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.[2]At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2012, Sherman was honored by actor Steve Martin.[70] In 2012, Sherman was among the artists whose works were given as trophies to the filmmakers of winning pictures in the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival's jury competitions.[71]Art market[edit]In 2010, Sherman’s nearly six foot tall chromogenic color print Untitled #153 (1985), featuring the artist as a mudcaked corpse, was sold by Phillips de Pury & Company for a record $2.7 million, near the $3 million high estimate.[72] In 2011, a print of Untitled #96 fetched $3.89 million at Christie's, making it the most expensive photograph at that time.[73]Influence[edit]Sherman's work is often credited as a major influence for contemporary portrait photographers.[74] One such photographer is Ryan Trecartin, who manipulates themes of identity in his videos and photography.[75]In April 2014, actor and artist James Franco exhibited a series of photographs at the Pace Gallery called New Film Stills, in which Franco restaged twenty-nine images from Sherman's Untitled Film Stills.[76] The exhibit garnered mainly negative reviews, calling Franco's appropriations 'sophomoric,' 'sexist,' and embarrassingly clueless.'[77][78]Personal life[edit]Sherman married director Michel Auder in 1984, making her stepmother to Auder's daughter, Alexandra, and her half-sister Gaby Hoffmann.[79] They divorced in 1999.[80] From 2007 to 2011, she had a relationship with the artist David Byrne.[81] Between 1991 and 2005,[82] she lived in a fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood; she later sold it to actor Hank Azaria.[83] She bought two floors in a 10-story condo building overlooking the Hudson River in West Soho,[38][82] and today uses one as her apartment and the other as her studio and office.[84]Sherman long spent her summers in Catskill Mountains.[85] In 2000, she bought songwriter Marvin Hamlisch's[85] 4,200-square-foot house on 0.4 acre in Sag Harbor for $1.5 million.[86] She later acquired a 19th-century home on a ten-acre waterfront[87] property on Accabonac Harbor in East Hampton, New York.[88][89]Sherman serves on the artistic advisory committee of the New York City-based Stephen Petronio Company.[90] Along with David Byrne, she was a member of Portugal's Estoril Film Festival's jury in 2009.[91]In 2012, she joined Yoko Ono and nearly 150 fellow artists in the founding of Artists Against Fracking, a group in opposition to hydraulic fracturing to remove gas from underground deposits.[92]Sherman has expressed contempt for social media platforms, calling them \"so vulgar.\" [50]Controversy[edit]Sherman has been criticized for her early Bus Riders series (1976–2000).[93] American Theatre critic Margo Jefferson has written, \"[The African-American figures] all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"[94]Books[edit] Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman.

Cynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits.In 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.[1] In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.[2] She Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression.Early life and education[edit]Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman.[3][4][5] Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft.[6] Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.[7].In 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing.[8] Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\"[9] Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\"[10] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms.[11] At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties.[12] This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.[8]In 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.[13]It was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.[14] Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.[15]Photography[edit]Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.[16]Early work[edit]Bus Riders (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Margo Jefferson on the bus riders series: \"a series of 15 black-and-white photographs from 1976 in which she impersonates black and white bus riders. They are male and female, young and aging; they are street kids, workers and yuppies. But the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"Other early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.In her landmark photograph series, the Untitled Film Stills, (1977–80), Sherman appeared as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”Many of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".\"I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\"[17]She explained to the New York Times in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”Untitled Film Stills[edit]The series Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors),[18] producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.[19] She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity.[20] She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society.[8] Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.[21] Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment. The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups: The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4). The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo in 1976 and began a relationship with him)[22] Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21 Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979))[13] She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father[23] at sunset one evening during the trip. The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.[24] The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan purchased the series for an estimated $1 million in 1995.[25]1980s[edit]In addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms—the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s Fairy Tales and Disasters sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.[citation needed]It was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine.[26] She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine.[27] About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”[10]In 1982, Sherman began her Pink Robes series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.[28]In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time.[19] Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series,[23] Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.[citation needed]Between 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title History Portraits.[29][30]1990s[edit]Sex Pictures[edit]Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” [31] Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” [32] Reviewer Jerry Saltz told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.”[33] Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color.[34]With her Sex Pictures, Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon[35]2000s[edit]Between 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.Her exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11)[36] accompanied by films selected by Sherman.[37] Based on a 32-page insert[38] Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.[39]In 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\".[40] Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.[41]Fashion[edit]Sherman’s career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs.[42] In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine.[43] Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in Harper's Bazaar in 1993.[44] In 1994, she produced the Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.[citation needed]In 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga) in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010.[45] Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.[46]Music and films[edit]In the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums Fontanelle and Painkillers, creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\"[47] She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie Office Killer in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman and has a shared interest with arranging bodies and is like a puppeteer and arranges her own dioramas.[48][page needed] According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, Office Killer is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece.[48] The film got mixed reviews. In a review for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" [49] Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" [50] Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film Pecker, and also appeared in The Feature in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award.[citation needed] Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her Untitled Horror series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. Office Killer grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"[51]In the catalog essay[52] by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to Office Killer being created. The catalog also includes a conversation between Sherman and the director of the exhibit, Sofia Coppola, in which Sherman admits that she may star in an upcoming film project.[50]Exhibitions[edit]Sherman's first solo show in New York was presented at a noncommercial space called the Kitchen in 1980. When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show.[53] “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist.[23]Sherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2006), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman’s work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007). In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show \"The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[54]In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art mounted “Cindy Sherman,” a show that chronicled Sherman's work from the mid-1970s on and include more than 170 photographs. The exhibition travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.[55] In 2013, Sherman was invited to organize a show within that year's Venice Biennale.[56]In 2016, after a sabbatical from her studio which was spent \"coming to terms with health issues and getting older,\" Sherman produced and staged her first photo gallery in five years. The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.[57][58]Collections[edit]Works by Sherman are held in the following collection: The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59] Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NY Feminism[edit]Sherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series Centerfolds contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series Society Pictures addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 Imitation of Life, explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.[57]When writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal October, the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\" [60]However, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"[61]Many scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's Untitled series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.[62]Others question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's,[63][64] and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.Sherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"[65]In addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster[66] and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like Vomit Pictures as de-fetishizing the female body.[62]Scholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.[67]Recognition[edit]In 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York.[68] In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships.[citation needed] This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work. Among her awards are the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (1993);[citation needed] Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1997);[citation needed] Hasselblad Award (1999);[citation needed] Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Arts (2005);[citation needed] American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award (2003);[citation needed] National Arts Award (2001);[citation needed] Jewish Museum’s Man Ray Award (2009);[69] and the Roswitha Haftmann Prize (2012).[citation needed] In 2010, Sherman was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.[citation needed] She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.[2]At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2012, Sherman was honored by actor Steve Martin.[70] In 2012, Sherman was among the artists whose works were given as trophies to the filmmakers of winning pictures in the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival's jury competitions.[71]Art market[edit]In 2010, Sherman’s nearly six foot tall chromogenic color print Untitled #153 (1985), featuring the artist as a mudcaked corpse, was sold by Phillips de Pury & Company for a record $2.7 million, near the $3 million high estimate.[72] In 2011, a print of Untitled #96 fetched $3.89 million at Christie's, making it the most expensive photograph at that time.[73]Influence[edit]Sherman's work is often credited as a major influence for contemporary portrait photographers.[74] One such photographer is Ryan Trecartin, who manipulates themes of identity in his videos and photography.[75]In April 2014, actor and artist James Franco exhibited a series of photographs at the Pace Gallery called New Film Stills, in which Franco restaged twenty-nine images from Sherman's Untitled Film Stills.[76] The exhibit garnered mainly negative reviews, calling Franco's appropriations 'sophomoric,' 'sexist,' and embarrassingly clueless.'[77][78]Personal life[edit]Sherman married director Michel Auder in 1984, making her stepmother to Auder's daughter, Alexandra, and her half-sister Gaby Hoffmann.[79] They divorced in 1999.[80] From 2007 to 2011, she had a relationship with the artist David Byrne.[81] Between 1991 and 2005,[82] she lived in a fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood; she later sold it to actor Hank Azaria.[83] She bought two floors in a 10-story condo building overlooking the Hudson River in West Soho,[38][82] and today uses one as her apartment and the other as her studio and office.[84]Sherman long spent her summers in Catskill Mountains.[85] In 2000, she bought songwriter Marvin Hamlisch's[85] 4,200-square-foot house on 0.4 acre in Sag Harbor for $1.5 million.[86] She later acquired a 19th-century home on a ten-acre waterfront[87] property on Accabonac Harbor in East Hampton, New York.[88][89]Sherman serves on the artistic advisory committee of the New York City-based Stephen Petronio Company.[90] Along with David Byrne, she was a member of Portugal's Estoril Film Festival's jury in 2009.[91]In 2012, she joined Yoko Ono and nearly 150 fellow artists in the founding of Artists Against Fracking, a group in opposition to hydraulic fracturing to remove gas from underground deposits.[92]Sherman has expressed contempt for social media platforms, calling them \"so vulgar.\" [50]Controversy[edit]Sherman has been criticized for her early Bus Riders series (1976–2000).[93] American Theatre critic Margo Jefferson has written, \"[The African-American figures] all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"[94]Books[edit] Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman.

Cynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits.Cynthia Morris ShermanconceptualIn 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship.[1] In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.[2] She Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression.MacArthur Fellowship[1][1]Royal College of Art[2][2]Early life and education[edit]Early life and education[edit][edit]Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman.[3][4][5] Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft.[6] Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.[7].Glen Ridge, New Jersey[3][3][4][4][5][5]HuntingtonGrumman Aircraft[6][6][7][7]In 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing.[8] Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\"[9] Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\"[10] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms.[11] At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties.[12] This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.[8]visual artsBuffalo State College[8][8][9][9][10][10][11][11]Robert Longo[12][12][8][8]In 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.[13]Charles CloughNancy DwyerHallwallsAlbright-Knox Art GallerySUNYArtparkLewiston, N.Y[13][13]It was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.[14] Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.[15]Hannah WilkeEleanor AntinAdrian Piper[14][14]Laurie SimmonsLouise LawlerBarbara KrugerPictures Generation[15][15]Photography[edit]Photography[edit][edit]Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.[16][16][16]Early work[edit]Early work[edit][edit]Bus Riders (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Margo Jefferson on the bus riders series: \"a series of 15 black-and-white photographs from 1976 in which she impersonates black and white bus riders. They are male and female, young and aging; they are street kids, workers and yuppies. But the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order.\"Bus RidersOther early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.In her landmark photograph series, the Untitled Film Stills, (1977–80), Sherman appeared as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”Untitled Film StillsMany of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".Centerfolds,\"I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\"[17][17][17]She explained to the New York Times in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”New York TimesUntitled Film Stills[edit]Untitled Film StillsUntitled Film Stills[edit][edit]The series Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors),[18] producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.[19] She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity.[20] She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society.[8] Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.[21] Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment. The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups:Untitled Film StillsUntitled Film Stills[18][18][19][19][20][20][8][8][21][21]Untitled Film Still #11Untitled Film Stills The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4). The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo in 1976 and began a relationship with him)[22] Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21 Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979))[13] She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father[23] at sunset one evening during the trip. The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.[24] The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4).Untitled #4The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island.

These and other series, like the 1980s Fairy Tales and Disasters sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.[citation needed]Fairy Tales and DisastersMetro Pictures Gallery[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededIt was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine.[26] She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine.[27] About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”[10]Rear Screen ProjectionsCenterfolds/HorizontalsArtforum[26][26][27][27][10][10]In 1982, Sherman began her Pink Robes series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.[28]Pink Robes[28][28]In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time.[19] Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series,[23] Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.[citation needed]Fairy TalesDisastersmannequins[19][19]NEARobert MapplethorpeAndres SerranoCorcoran Gallery of ArtJeff Koons[23][23]Sexin flagrante delicto[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededBetween 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title History Portraits.[29][30]History Portraits[29][29][30][30]1990s[edit]1990s[edit][edit]Sex Pictures[edit]Sex PicturesSex Pictures[edit][edit]Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” [31] Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” [32] Reviewer Jerry Saltz told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.”[33] Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color.[34]With her Sex Pictures, Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon[35]prostheticmannequinsSex PicturesHal FosterSex PicturesObscene, Abject, Traumatic[31][31]Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman[32][32]Jerry SaltzNew York magazineNew York[33][33]Sex PicturesprostheticsSex Pictures[34][34]Sex Pictures[35][35]2000s[edit]2000s[edit][edit]Between 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.ClownsSociety PortraitsHer exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11)[36] accompanied by films selected by Sherman.[37] Based on a 32-page insert[38] Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.[39][36][36][37][37][38][38]POPPOPChanel2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull[39][39]In 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\".[40] Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.[41][40][40][41][41]Fashion[edit]Fashion[edit][edit]Sherman’s career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs.[42] In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine.[43] Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in Harper's Bazaar in 1993.[44] In 1994, she produced the Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.[citation needed][42][42]Interview magazine[43][43]Harper's BazaarHarper's Bazaar[44][44]Post Card Series for Comme des GarçonsComme des GarçonsRei Kawakubo[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededIn 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga) in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010.[45] Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.[46]Marc JacobsJuergen TellerBalenciagaCindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga)[45][45]Anna Hu[46][46]Music and films[edit]Music and films[edit][edit]In the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums Fontanelle and Painkillers, creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\"[47] She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie Office Killer in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman and has a shared interest with arranging bodies and is like a puppeteer and arranges her own dioramas.[48][page needed] According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, Office Killer is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece.[48] The film got mixed reviews. In a review for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" [49] Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" [50] Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film Pecker, and also appeared in The Feature in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award.[citation needed] Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her Untitled Horror series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. Office Killer grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"[51]Babes in ToylandFontanellePainkillers[47][47]Office KillerOffice KillerJeanne TripplehornMolly RingwaldCarol Kane[48][48][page needed]page neededpage neededpage neededDahlia SchweitzerOffice Killer[48][48]The New York Times[49][49][50][50]cameo roleJohn WatersPeckerPeckerThe FeatureThe FeatureMichel Auder[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededUntitled HorrorOffice Killer[51][51]In the catalog essay[52] by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to Office Killer being created.

When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show.[53] “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist.[23]Metro Pictures Gallery[53][53][23][23]Sherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2006), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman’s work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007).

The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.[57][58]sabbatical1959 melodramaDouglas Sirkglamour portraitsHollywoodGloria SwansonMary PickfordRuby KeelerMetro Pictures GalleryNew York CityLos AngelesSpruth Magers galleryBerlin, GermanyWexner Center for the ArtsColumbus, Ohio[57][57][58][58]Collections[edit]Collections[edit][edit]Works by Sherman are held in the following collection: The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59] Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NY The Broad, Los Angeles, CA[59]The Broad[59][59]Jewish Museum (Manhattan), New York NYJewish Museum (Manhattan)Feminism[edit]Feminism[edit][edit]Sherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series Centerfolds contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series Society Pictures addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 Imitation of Life, explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.[57]feminismCenterfoldsSociety PicturesImitation of Life[57][57]When writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal October, the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\" [60]October[60][60]However, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"[61][61][61]Many scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's Untitled series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.[62]gazeUntitledmale gaze[62][62]Others question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's,[63][64] and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.[63][63][64][64]Sherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"[65]UntitledCreative Camera,[65][65]In addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster[66] and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like Vomit Pictures as de-fetishizing the female body.[62]Abjection[66][66]Vomit Pictures[62][62]Scholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.[67][67][67]Recognition[edit]Recognition[edit][edit]In 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York.[68] In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships.[citation needed] This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work.
